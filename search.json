    "text": "Greater Romania Party\nGreater Romania Party (Partidul România Mare, PRM) was an agrarian, nationalist and socially conservative populist party dominated by its long-time leader Corneliu Tudor. Founded in 1991 as an offshoot of the extreme nationalist Movement for a Greater Romania, it has been highly nostalgic for the Ceauşescu regime (for which Tudor was once a propagandist) and the WWII era fascist movements that allied with the Nazis (Ţurcanu 2010; Andreescu 2003, 20). Tudor was a staple of elections in the 1990s and the PRM peaked in the 2000 presidential and parliamentary elections, after which it gradually declined to obscurity.\nAside from a brief attempt to appear more moderate around 2004-05 (when it wanted to join the European People’s Party), the PRM’s radical programme has been very consistent. There were several components to Tudor’s radical right nativist politics. The first was ethnocentrism, particularly regarding his hostility towards Jews, Roma, ethnic Hungarians in Romania, and others (Ţurcanu 2010, 6–7; Andreescu 2003, 31; Gallagher 1995, 205). He repeatedly denied the holocaust (Shafir 2008, 456), campaigned to have the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania party banned (Smrčková 2012, 209), and glorified the anti-Semitic ideology of the inter-war Iron Guard militia (Smrčková 2012, 213) (OTH_ETHNIC = 3). The party was also very socially conservative, opposing homosexuality and championing the Romanian family (Norocel 2011). We have found no evidence that immigrants were a relevant target of Tudor’s nationalism (OTH_IMMIGRANTS = 1), although this is probably due mainly to the low rates of immigration into Romania at that time, and should be confirmed by further research.\nTudor was also sharply hostile to a number of foreign powers: for example decrying the “ever more violent interference of foreign diplomats accredited to Bucharest in the state of affairs in Romania” (Gallagher 1995, 207). Hungary, the EU, the IMF, and the United States (He once accused the US ambassador of assisting in the rigging of EU elections) (Shafir 2008, 457) were frequent enemies of the Romanian people (OTH_FOREIGN = 3). For a time the PRM was also the only significant anti-EU party in the Romanian parliament (Sum 2010, 19).\nAccording to Mungiu-Pippidi, Tudor tapped into a well-established (Ceauşescu era) personality-led populist tradition essentially hostile to politicians and parties (Mungiu‐Pippidi 2001, 231). This has led to an established anti-politics populism that reaps protest votes from citizens frustrated with the political and economic system writ large (Smrčková 2012, 208; Ţurcanu 2010, 8; Busuioc 2016, 42; Gallagher 2001, 112; Andreescu 2003, 69) (OTH_POLCLASS = 3). Like other nativist parties in the region, the PRM’s economic programme is somewhat leftist (Mungiu‐Pippidi 2001, 235; Sum 2010, 21; Ţurcanu 2010, 9), advocating the nationalisation of industry and robust welfare spending (to ethnic Romanians) (Smrčková 2012, 214). While the party should still be classified as FR on LRPOSITION, it does exhibit some opposition to economic elites, particularly relating to foreign capital (Smrčková 2012, 214) (OTH_FINANCIAL = 2). Further research should confirm the degree of this.\nShafir considers the PRM to be an anti-system party aimed at maintaining the nationalist rhetoric of the Ceauşescu era in order to undermine democracy itself (Shafir 2008, 455). Tudor has frequently alleged electoral fraud after poor results (Shafir 2008, 457), and openly called for the military to lead a coup d’état against democracy in 1993 (Mungiu‐Pippidi 2001, 235). In another highly controversial incident, the party sided with highly militarised miners’ union strike (led by PRM vice president Miron Cosma) which marched on Bucharest, destroying police road-blocks in the process (Andreescu 2003, 34) (LIBDEMNORMS = 3). The party has been totally defined by the “cult of personality” of Tudor (Gallagher 2005, 295; Andreescu 2003, 32; Busuioc 2016, 42), and its decision making process is totally centralised around his leadership (Smrčková 2012, 210) (CHARISMA = 3). The PRM was once briefly in coalition government in 1992-1996. This, coupled with the fact that Tudor was an insider in the Ceauşescu regime, means that the PRM deserves a 2 for INSIDER."

    "text": "Romanian National Unity Party\nThe Romanian National Unity Party (Partidul Unităţii Naţionale a Românilor, PUNR), founded in 1990, was an ultranationalist party based around its leader, Gheorghe Funar, mayor of Cluj 1992-2004. The party was a successor to the violent Romanian Hearth movement which organised deadly clashes with ethnic Hungarians in the Transylvania region in 1990 (Andreescu 2003, 29). Funar had a heated rivalry with the PRM’s Tudor (Sum 2010), but after the PUNR melted away he joined the PRM to become its Secretary General in 1998, taking his remaining supporters with him (Smrčková 2012, 209).\nThe ethno-nationalist cause formed the basis of the PUNR’s radical ethno-nationalism (Petrovici 2011, 68) (OTH_ETHNIC = 3), with which is found moderate success in early post-communist elections as “the most important ultra-nationalist party in Romania” (Andreescu 2003, 30). True to their authoritarian origins, Funar and the party repeatedly incited attacks against the Hungarian minority in Transylvania (including the Hungarian consulate in Cluj) (Andreescu 2003, 59) and instituted martial law in majority Hungarian areas of Cluj (Gallagher 1995, 213) (LIBDEMNORMS = 3). Funer repeatedly denied foreign investment in Cluj on the reasoning that “we don’t sell our country to foreigners,” (Petrovici 2011, 69) (OTH_FOREIGN = 3). Note that this does not seem to be an indication of OTH_FINANCIAL rhetoric (= 1).\nThe picture on OTH_POLCLASS is less clear, however several sources point Funar’s general position that Bucharest did not appreciate the needs of Romanians in the North (Gallagher 2005, 103), and that it had become a “city of filth and corruption” that did not deserve to be the Romanian capital (Gallagher 1995, 203; see also Petrovici 2011, 70–71). While evidence for this rhetoric is not as clear as for Tudor, it does warrant at least a 2 on OTH_POLCLASS. Funar was “a believer in one-man leadership” (Gallagher 1995, 209), and his controversial image defined the PUNR (CHARISMA = 3)."

    "text": "People’s Party Dan Diaconescu\nPeople’s Party - Dan Diaconescu (Partidul Poporului – Dan Diaconescu, PP-DD) was a left wing nationalist party that emerged in 2010. Its founder and leader, Dan Diaconescu, is a former investigative journalist with a large audience, known for revealing sensational stories about corruption and political scandals (Gherghina and Miscoiu 2014, 187). After stunning success in the 2012 parliamentary elections, the party soon faced a downfall after Diaconescu was imprisoned on extortion charges (Busuioc 2016, 43).\nThe PP-DD has a somewhat confusing ideological profile, but has generally been called left-wing (Busuioc 2016, 43). Its programme was a crowd-pleasing set of contradictions, promising cash handouts of 20,000 Euros per citizen, free tractors, and jobs for everyone, with little detail on how it would be paid for (it also advocated cutting taxes) (Lavinia 2013, 22; Gherghina and Miscoiu 2014, 189). The party was generally critical of state privatisations and promised the confiscation of unjustified wealth (Lavinia 2013, 22) (OTH_FINANCIAL = 2). Diaconescu’s was a highly performative populism, as displayed by his spectacle of trying to buy the state-owned chemical firm Oltchim “in the name of the people and for the people” (Busuioc 2016, 43) in 2012.\nThe party did have some nationalist elements in its politics, such as its dismissal of ethnic-Hungarian’s demands for autonomy, and its hostility towards the IMF as a “foreign intruder”, and the policy of reuniting with Moldova (Gherghina and Miscoiu 2014, 187–90) (OTH_ETHNIC = 2, OTH_FOREIGN = 2). However, it is not particularly nativist in the sense of the PRM or PUNR (Cinpoeş 2013, 176). Instead, its principle “other” for the PP-DD was the political class, which it accused of a permanent conspiracy against the Romanian people (Gherghina and Miscoiu 2014, 187). This was given momentum by the 2012 constitutional crisis and anti-government demonstrations. The party drew a simple distinction between the people affected by the economic crisis and the established elite who caused it (Smrčková 2012, 207). It also alleged that all established rivals criticised each other in order to hide the extensive cross-party networks of corruption (Lavinia 2013, 17) (OTH_POLCLASS = 3).\nPP-DD It was – as its name suggests – totally dependent on its leader, who maintained total control of it (Gherghina and Miscoiu 2014, 189; Gherghina and Soare 2013, 1) (CHARISMA = 3). Interestingly, most of the PP-DD candidates were former members of ruling party members (Lavinia 2013, 17). However, as the party leader or the party itself has never been in power, we have coded it 1 on INSIDER. We have seen no evidence that it threatened LIBDEMNORMS (1).\nReferences\nAndreescu, Gabriel. 2003. Right-Wing Extremism in Romania.

The PRI governed Mexico from 1930 until 2000 and, although other parties were legalized, participated in elections and obtained some seats, victory over the PRI was virtually impossible due to the corruption of the electoral system. It was not until the electoral reforms of the 1990s were implemented, that Vicente Fox, from the PAN, was able to become the president in 2000. Thus, electoral results before the year 2000 should be taken with caution since elections were not fully democratic. Elections to the Senate coincide with the presidential elections since 2003, thus, there are no elections to the Upper House in the legislative midterms since 2003."

    "section": "Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas / PRD",
    "text": "Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas / PRD\nOne of the most famous leaders of el PRI was Lázaro Cárdenas, which is considered the prototype of populist leader in Mexico. His son, Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas, was a member of the PRI but left it criticizing that the party had lost its revolutionary origins and initiated a movement within the PRI called “Corriente Democrática”. Rejection by PRI leadership of this current’s claims to democratize the party led to the expelling of Cárdenas and encouraged him to run in the 1988 presidential election against the PRI with a populist platform. Basurto (1999: 95) argues that Cuauhtémoc “resurrected the ideology of his father, based on the so-called revolutionary nationalism and on populist mobilization of the masses”. The internal document of the “Corriente Democrática” (1988: 40) already contains most of Cárdenas later ideas and argues for the validity of the principles of the Mexican Revolution and for the “reconquering of the independence and dignity of the people”. They stated that their fight was for “for the rescue of the full meaning of citizenship, for social equality, for the productive economy, for natural resources, for cultural identity and for the high moral hierarchy of the nation” (Corriente Democrática, 1988: 40). Neo-Cardenistas, as Basurto (1999: 84) calls them, strongly opposed neoliberalism and their economic nationalism fueled a double criticism against financial elites and foreign interests. Cuauhtémoc (1987: 307) argued that “behind the sources of credit stand vested political and economic interests that, in addition to mere financial profits, sought to transform a commercial relationship into one of political dependency. Negotiations concerning our debt are dominated by our imperialistic neighbor, whose government has been dangerously aggressive”. Thus, I have coded 3 in both Financial Elites and in Foreign Interests.\nCuauhtémoc ran under the coalition “National Democratic Front” in 1998, which was supported by the Popular Socialist Party, the Authentic Party of the Mexican Revolution, among others. He then founded the “Party of the Democratic Revolution” (or PRD) in 1989, which assumed most of the ideas of the National Democratic Front and the “Corriente Democrática”.\nAnother of the main tropes in Cárdenas’ rhetoric is the renovation of Mexican politics, due to the corruption of the parties. “Corriente Democrática” argued for the implementation of primaries inside the PRI and the PRD defended the full democratization of the country (Basurto, 1999: 87). Although the PRD shared objectives with the Zapatistas, they rejected their military approach (Basurto, 1999: 91). Therefore, I have coded 1 in Violation of LD norms since the PRD argues strongly for a deeper democratization of Mexico. Before leaving the PRI, Cárdenas had been part of the government, member of the senate and governor of a province. Thus, although he was not in the inner circle of decision making, he was a well-established figure in the previous regime. I have coded 2 for Inner Populism.\nThe Mexican army was seen by important sectors of the left as part of the establishment, particularly since the massacre of Tlatelolco in 1968. However, as the son of a general, Cuauhtémoc was less aggressive towards the military that other leftists and valued its function as the guarantor of national sovereignty. Its position was that an investigation needed to happen on the events of 1968 but that the military as a whole could not be blamed for it (Cárdenas, 1998). Thus, I have coded 1 for Military. Although Cuauhtémoc’s personal history and his initiative in splitting from the PRI are essential to understand the PRD, the fact that it was born out of a previous movement inside the party points that Cárdenas acted more as the catalyzer than as the creator of the movement. I have coded 1 in Personality Dependent. There is no negative mention of immigrants or ethnic others in the PRD’s discourse.\nIn 2018, the PRD becomes part of a cross-party presidential coalition lead by the PAN, which greatly dilutes their former populist stance. I have not included the PRD in the 2018 election."

    "text": "Andrés Manuel López Obrador\nUnder Cárdenas’ leadership, the PRD participated in all elections running on a similar platform. In the 2006 presidential elections, the party presented Andrés Manuel López Obrador (commonly known as AMLO) as the presidential candidate. AMLO followed Cárdenas when he left the PRI, unsuccessfully tried to become governor of the province of Tabasco with the PRD in the 1990s, became the president of the PRD in 1996 and achieved the position of governor of the Federal District from 2000 until 2005. Although he occupied important positions in Mexican politics, he did not belong to the inner circle of PRI’s decision making and, for that reason, I have coded 1 in Insider Populism. AMLO was very popular in the polls (Álvarez Béjar, 2006: 27) and his political campaign was in large part based on his figure (Espinoza and Navarrete, 2016: 94). Moreover, he had important differences with his party such as running on a political platform more moderate (Bruhn, 2012: 91) and strongly criticizing its former leader (Cruz González, 2006). Therefore, given his efforts to distinguish itself from a party and his popularity, I have coded 2 in Personality Dependent.\nAccording to Bruhn (2012) AMLO’s platform in 2006 had two souls. On the one side, AMLO refrained from employing a Manichean distinction between people and elites on speeches with the mass media and in television ads (Bruhn, 2012: 91-92). Moreover, his economic proposals were quite moderate and “substantially to the right of his own party’s platform” (Bruhn, 2012: 91). The party and AMLO self-identified as left-wing and that was how the electorate perceived the party, but it should be noted that López Obrador toned down this position during his campaign. On the other side, however, AMLO employed a strong populist discourse in campaign rallies and speeches in plazas and other public spaces. Bruhn (2012: 92) has analyzed quantitatively AMLO’s discourses and finds that references to a morally superior people and blaming of a corrupt elite are extremely common in his rallies. AMLO stated, for example, that “what we have to do therefore is unite the people, this is the struggle of the whole people of Mexico to defend its interests, against a band that has perpetuated itself in power and has carried our country to ruin, that’s how clear things are” (López Obrador 2006a) and that “those at the very top do not want to let go of power ... they cannot be satisfied, they want to continue devouring the country, but enough already, now it’s the people’s turn; it is time now for the people to govern our country, for the people to benefit” (López Obrador 2006b).\nThe distinction between elites and masses is mainly based on political terms. The long dominance of the PRI facilitated the distinction between “the corrupt and outdated institutions that have the people oppressed” (López Obrador, 2005). Institutional corruption is the basis of his campaign although he is also committed to social equality, being one of his most important mottos: “for the good of all, the poor first”. Moreover, his discourse towards the PAN was based on equating the PAN with the policies and attitudes of the PRI (Bruhn, 2012: 93). Lastly, although it is not one of the main axes of his discourse, AMLO has criticized several times the existing NAFTA agreement as detrimental for Mexico and in need for improvement (Cattan and McKee, 2018). Therefore, I have coded Left for ideology, 3 for Political Class, 2 for Foreign Interest and 2 for Financial Elites.\nIn 2006 AMLO argued for the need to “give more power to the military in all issues related to the fight against the drug cartels and organized crimes” (López Obrador, 2006c), he has also reiterated constantly his support to the Mexican indigenous peoples and does not have a negative view of immigrants.\nAMLO lost the 2006 election by a very small margin. López Obrador did not accept the result, called into question the electoral system and even declared himself as the legitimate president of Mexico. The courts denied a recount of the votes and AMLO called for protests and blocked important streets in Mexico and the US Embassy. According to Bruhn (2012: 98) AMLO’s attempt to create a constitutional crisis shows that his commitment to liberal democratic institutions was very shallow. The constitutional crisis did not succeed because AMLO misjudged the level of support from the population. Nonetheless, this experience radicalized his discourse and made AMLO emphasize his populist discourse. As an example of his discourse, in 2007, he wrote a book titled: “The Mafia Stole the Presidency from US”. Even if it happened after the election, I have coded 3 in violation of LD norms in the 2006 election given the time closeness. In fact, this was not the first time he denounced corrupt elections. In his unsuccessful campaigns in the 1990s to become governor of Tabasco he also complained of electoral fraud and in his more recent position as president he is concentrating enormous power in his figure. Moreover, he also rejected calling Enrique Peña Nieto the legitimate president of Mexico, although he won the 2012 elections. Therefore, AMLO’s shallow commitment to LD norms does not seem to be restricted to a specific moment.\nAMLO run his 2012 and 2018 campaigns under a similar platform to that of 2006, which emphasizes institutional corruption as the main trope of his populist discourse but putting forward center-left policies. After the defeat in 2012, AMLO created his own new party, the “Movement for National Regeneration” or MORENA, as it is popularly called. This party participated in the 2015 midterms and in the 2018 legislative elections and constituted the main party of the presidential coalition with which AMLO obtained the presidency in 2018. The party, as López Obrador’s personal platform, is based entirely on AMLO’s discourse and persona (Espinoza and Navarrete, 2016: 97). That is why I have labelled 3 for Personality Dependent."

In the context of a hegemonic party system, the hegemonic party allows the existence of other parties that have limited freedom and that, ultimately, respond to the interests of the main party. In this sense, their support for the presidential campaign of Cuauhtémoc in 1988 constitutes more an exception than the rule of action of these parties. All three rejected being included in the PRD and sidelined again with the PRI in the 90’s. They lack a strong populist discourse because they are part of the system and thus, they cannot be considered populist parties. Therefore, I have not included those parties in the database.

    "text": "The Independent Smallholders’ and Peasant Party (Fiiggetlen Kisgazda Pirt, FKgP), sometimes called just the “smallholders” party, was the most popular party in the brief democratic period before the Communist takeover in 1945. In its post-communist reformation its main mission was to re-privatise rural land back to the peasants from whom it had been confiscated under the previous regime (Ilonszki and Kurtán 1992, 423), taking the character of a sectional agrarian party (Körösényi 1999, 66). Under the leadership of József Torgyán it won almost 12% in the 1990 election and formed a coalition with the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF) in the first post-communist government of Józef Antall. After this government disappointed the party’s aims of rural land redistribution Torgyán left the coalition and the party split (Lomax 1995, 132). Thereafter Torgyán consolidated his hold on the party in opposition and led it to win 9% and 13% in 1994 and 1998 respectively. It then featured as a junior partner in the Fidesz government of 1998-02, during which further internal splits and corruption scandals saw its decline into irrelevance by 2002 (Sitter 2011, 253).\nThe party has been frequently considered populist in the literature due to the what Enyedi calls its “radical protest-party strategy” (Enyedi 2017, 178). In his “anti-elite approach” (Körösényi 1999, 45), Torgyán used highly inflammatory rhetoric against his political rivals, whom he accused of “selling out the country” (Batory 2002, 532). For example, at one rally in Budapest he called the leaders of the governing parties “disgusting pseudo-liberal worms and vultures that have inundated [our] country” and that “as spring is coming, it is time for Hungarians to launch a de-worming campaign” (cited in Nagle 1997, 44). Similarly, when the government did not punish former communist leaders for “crimes against Magyardom” Torgyán “tried to whip up a hysterical campaign against the government for its readiness to compromise” (Fowkes 1999, 27). In contrast to this elite, Torgyán offered “easy solutions” to the country's problems (Oltay 1995, 748). We’ve therefore coded FKgP 3 on OTH_POLCLASS.\nTorgyán and the FKgP “pushed a radical anti-foreigner, Hungarian nationalist politics” which increased in the years of IMF-imposed austerity budget (Nagle 1997, 44), at which time the party accused the government of subservience to international financial institutions (Lomax 1999, 116). We’ve not seen evidence of anti-foreign “others” in the party’s discourse before this period though, so we’ve coded it 2 on OTH_FOREIGN in 1998 only, and 1 before this. Despite its right wing-nationalism, sources did not reveal significant hostility towards ethnic “others” (OTH_ETHNIC = 1) or hostility to migrants (OTH_IMMIGRANTS =1). Some sources have noted that the party engaged in “economic populism” (Rosůlek 2011, 77; Fowler 2004, 100), however this seems to be a reference to the politics of land redistribution than class-based grievances against business or the wealthy (OTH_FINANCIAL = 1). Likewise, we’ve seen no evidence for anything on the OTH_MILITARY variable (= 1).\nAlthough it did not have a clear ideological position (Körösényi 1999, 66), most studies of the 1990s Hungarian party system place the FKgP on the right (Fazekas and Fekete 2018, 135), the “centre-right” (Rosůlek 2011, 69), or “conservative” (Z. Kovács 2001, 258; Körösényi 1999, 32), and it is usually placed in the “Christian nationalist” camp (Enyedi 2017, 197). Many sources claim that the party was “radical” (Körösényi 1999, 66; Rosůlek 2011, 77; Fowler 2004, 84), but this appears to relate more to its populist theatrics and accusations than its ideological stance. Hence we’ve labelled it R on LRPOSITION.\nAs the FKgP had a long lineage to the pre-communist era, in its first election it could not be considered a leader-dependent party. However, after by the 1994 election, internal purges and reforms changed this. Under the “demagogic” leadership of Torgyán (Lomax 1999, 116), the party could be better defined “by personal appeal of its charismatic leader than by its political programme” (Enyedi 2017, 178), and under a party constitution passed in 1991, as party president Torgyán had total control over it (Lomax 1995, 131; Fowler 2004, 108). When the party’s parliamentary faction split in 1991, it was clear that the majority of its members backed Torgyán and at the 1994 elections none of the anti-Torgyán MPs were returned (Fowler 2004, 84–85). We’ve therefore coded the party 2 on CHARISMA in 1990 and 3 from 1994. Despite its advocacy for reforming the constitution (to recall MPS and disband the Constitutional Court among other things) (Körösényi 1999, 45), Rosůlek has noted that the party was loyal to democracy (Rosůlek 2011, 77), and hence we’ve coded it 1 on LIBDEMNORMS. As the party was a coalition member in the first post-communist government from 1990, we’ve coded it 1 on INSIDER in 1990 and 2 afterwards."

    "text": "Hungarian Justice and Life Party\nThe Party of Hungarian Justice and Life (Magyar Igazság és Élet Pártja, MIÉP) was founded by former playwright István Csurka. Prior to this Csurka had been the leader of a radical right populist faction of the ruling Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF) (A. Kovács 2013, 223). Csurka was ejected from the MDF in 1993 after publishing his notorious ‘A few thoughts’ tract the previous year, which was laced with neo-Nazism and antisemitism in its accusations against the political status quo (Szôcs 1998, 1100; Lomax 1995, 128). The name of the party was selected to mimic the ’Hungarian Life Movement”, an inter-war fascist group. The MIÉP had little success in its first election in 1994, but entered Parliament on a 5.47% vote share in the 1998 election. Its vote slipped below 5% in 2002, after which it created a coalition with Jobbik for the 2006, which only received 2.2%.\nCsuka’s political narrative was that there had been no real political change in the post-communist era, and that Hungary continued to be ruled by a “dwarf minority” (Rosůlek 2011, 82) of ‘anti-Hungarians’ (A. Kovács 2013, 223) and foreign interests (Lomax 1995, 128). Csurka campaigned in a way that pitted true Hungarians against a clear set of self-serving political enemies (Tóth and Grajczjár 2015, 134; Bozóki and Kriza 2008, 9). In his own words: “The enemy is quite clearly discernible: they are the”small circle of liberal and un-Hungarian people out to destroy the nation, who deliberately loot the coffers and occupy all key positions” (Bozóki and Kriza 2008, 9). This elite, a continuation of the old communist elite, was alleged to have consciously betrayed the nation (Szôcs 1998, 1100) (OTH_POLCLASS = 3).\nThe MIÉP was “xenophobic” (Bozóki and Kriza 2008, 8), “ethno-radical” (Egedy 2009, 49), and neo-Nazi (Markus 1998, 12), to the point that ethnically-based politics was “the essence of its ideology” (Bozóki and Kriza 2008, 9). In particular, it relied on a staunch antisemitism (M. Szabó 2006, 9; A. Kovács 2013, 223; Pirro 2014a, 256; Lomax 1999, 120; Chinatera-Stutte and Pető 2003, 6), which was evident in Csurka’s 1992 tract (Lomax 1995, 128). In addition to claiming that the former communist regime was controlled by Jews (LeBor 2008, 35), Csurka alleged that the post-1989 regime was loyal to international Jewish interests that aimed to “Palestinize” Hungary” (Tóth and Grajczjár 2015, 134). According to some analysis, this was an outgrowth of the late communist era, in which anti-semitism was a default form of protest (Szôcs 1998, 1097). In addition to this, Csurka and the MIÉP were hostile to Roma, opposition to whom was evident in the party’s platforms and manifestos (Pirro 2014b, 616; Kenes 2021, 17). All of this is easily sufficient to code the party 3 for OTH_ETHNIC. We’ve seen no mention of immigrants in the scholarship on the MIÉP, probably because this was not a major political issue in Hungary in the 1990s (OTH_IMMIGRANTS = 1).\nThat Hungarian politics and the Hungarian state was totally controlled by foreign entities attempting to “recolonize” Hungary (Kenes 2021, 5) was a constant theme in Csurka’s narrative (Chinatera-Stutte and Pető 2003, 6; see also Bozóki and Kriza 2008, 15; Lomax 1995, 128). Political rivals were deemed by the MIÉP to be “serving as the Hungarian outpost of international financial circles” (Tóth and Grajczjár 2015, 135), and forming “vassal governments” (Bozóki and Kriza 2008, 9) of those interests. While this foreign other was often kept vague, the Csurka and the party were explicitly opposed to the financial bodies like the IMF (Murer 2015, 84) and the EU (Kenes 2021, 5). In some phrasings, this was a plutocratic conspiracy controlled from London, New York, Brussels and Tel Aviv (Agocs and Agocs 1994, 79; Murer 1999, 23). In the words of Kovács:\n\nThe tensions caused by economic and cultural globalization were portrayed as a conflict between cosmopolitan and national interests, joining international integration as a loss of national sovereignty, and the social consequences of the economic and political transition as the result of being at the mercy of colonial masters (A. Kovács 2013, 223).\n\nWe’ve coded the MIÉP 3 on OTH_FOREIGN.\nThere is an overlap between this anti-foreign narrative and hostility towards economic and financial powerbrokers. Csurka and the MIÉP have identified “thieving capitalists” (Murer 2015, 83) and “Big Money” (Bozóki and Kriza 2008, 16) as enemies of the Hungarian people, and developed a narrative whereby global capitalist organisations have set out to “ruin” Hungary (Murer 2015, 82; see also Kenes 2021, 5). While this aspect of its rhetoric is somewhat thin in the scholarship on the party, we’ve labelled it 3 on the evidence available, although this could be revisited. We’ve seen no evidence for anything on the OTH_MILITARY variable (= 1).\nThe MIÉP is usually classed as “extreme right” (Palonen 2010, 14), or “ultra-right-wing” (Lomax 1999, 117). Its policy framing and criticism of capitalism had some left-leaning traits (Szôcs 1998, 1101), but according to Bozóki and Kriza it did “not seek solutions to problems in the domain of social and welfare politics, instead, it consistently looks to answers steeped in racial and ethnic tint” (Bozóki and Kriza 2008, 9). Hence we’ve coded it FR. Csurka has been called a “heavyweight” in his status as a leader and an intellectual (Szôcs 1998, 1105), who exerted “dominance” within the party and the far right more generally (Dániel Mikecz 2015, 106). According to Bozóki and Kriza, “Csurka exerts a completely determining influence on [the parliamentary MIÉP] … his authority in MIÉP is unquestionable and his weekly ‘orientations’ serve as signposts for the party faithful on political and ideological issues.” (Bozóki and Kriza 2008, 8–9). We’ve therefore coded the MIÉP 3 on CHARISMA. Given that Csurka was a major faction leader in the governing MDF party from 1990, we’ve labelled the MIÉP 2 on INSIDER\nCsurka and the MIÉP were anti-liberal (Chinatera-Stutte and Pető 2003, 6) and anti-democratic (Kenes 2021, 5; Bozóki and Kriza 2008, 16). Csurka made vague threats of violence if his enemies attempted their grand plans (Chinatera-Stutte and Pető 2003, 6) and MIÉP rallies were often attended by skinheads (Murer 1999, 36). Csurka also rejected media criticism on the grounds that the media was controlled by Jews (Murer 1999, 17), and he rejected the results of elections and the legitimacy of elected governments (Bozóki and Kriza 2008, 16). We’ve therefore coded the party 3 on LIBDEMNORMS."

    "text": "Fidesz\nThe “Alliance of Young Democrats” (Fiatal Demokratak Szovetsege, ‘FIDESZ’) is a former dissident youth movement from the late communist period that transitioned into a mainstream party in the 1990s (M. Szabó 2011). The party has been in power twice in its history, between 1998 and 2002, and 2010-present, both times under the leadership of founder Viktor Orbán. The party’s second stint in power started in the context of both the financial crisis and a host of scandals within the previous socialist government (Rydliński 2018, 96), an environment which saw Fidesz received two thirds majority in Parliament (off a 53% vote). The party has gone on to win twice more in succession, albeit not with the same vote share as 2010. Since the 2006 election the party has officially served in an electoral alliance with the historical Christian Democratic Party (KNDP).\nExactly when Fidesz should be counted as populist by our definition is debatable. According to numerous sources, the party was a mainstream liberal party in the 1990s (M. Szabó 2011, 47), and studies of Hungarian politics in this era do not mention it as a populist force (see for example Fowler 2004; Hanley et al. 2008). Its 1998 election slogan was “[do] more than change the government, but less than change the system” (Egedy 2009, 47), and while in government 1998-02 it was a progressive pro-European party (Palonen 2009, 329) whose policies were not very different from the other parties (Palonen 2010, 11). According to numerous sources, the party’s defeat in 2002 was the trigger of its major rhetorical shift towards populist discourse (M. Szabó 2011, 50), at which point Orbán “transformed his rhetoric” and adopted “anti-elitism” (Palonen 2018, 314), claiming that the new government was the product of “electoral manipulation” at the expense of ordinary Hungarians (M. Szabó 2006, 1; Halmai 2018, 299). While some sources claim that the party fully embraced populist anti-elitism in the 2010 elections (Farkas 2018), or that this rhetoric picked up after its 2006 defeat (J. Szabó 2020, 30), we’ve followed the preponderance of the literature (see for example Palonen 2009, 324–25; Enyedi and Róna 2018, 252) to conclude that 2006 was the first election in which Fidesz engage in populist rhetoric by our definition, and hence it is included in the dataset from this point.\nAfter its embrace of populist rhetoric, the party has been defined as “anti-system, anti-establishment” (Palonen 2009, 323) and “anti-elitist” (Ádám and Bozóki 2011, 3). Within Orbán’s populist rhetoric, the elite are considered to be the entirely of the political establishment (Halmai 2018; Csehi 2019, 1016). This included former communist figures (the party’s original target) (Egedy 2009, 50), who were called “forces from the past” (Hegedüs 2019, 413) or simply “them” (M. Szabó 2011, 57), accused by the party of converting political power to wealth after the 1989 transition (Csigó and Merkovity 2016, 2), and plotting a communist restoration (Csehi 2019, 1016). In 2006, the leaking of a speech by Socialist Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsány admitting to dishonesty in the previous campaign triggered mass protests which prominently featured Fidesz (Ádám and Bozóki 2011, 12). The party was equally scathing of economic liberals, to the extent that it labelled the political class a “clandestine conspiracy of Communism and Capitalism” (M. Szabó 2006, 10). Once in power, NGOs and civil society groups critical of the government were consistently positioned within the political class (J. Szabó 2020, 32), particularly after the 2015 migrant crisis (Etl 2022, 5). These groups were considered corrupt foreign agents “attempting to enforce foreign interests upon Hungary” (Csehi 2019, 1016). In time this “other” would be defined as a shadowy but powerful class of international “elite” loyal to no nation but hostile to Hungary:\n\nTheir faces are not visible, but are hidden from view; they do not fight directly, but by stealth; they are not honorable, but unprincipled; they are not national, but international, they do not believe in work, but speculate with money; they have no homeland, but feel that the whole world is theirs (cited in Csehi 2019, 1019)\n\nAgainst this threat from the political class, Orbán styled himself and Fidesz as the only true representative of the nation (Bozóki 2012, 12), and in J. Szabó’s words, “the only one capable of defending the people” (J. Szabó 2020, 32). In fact, after losing in 2002, Orbán rejected the idea that he and in Fidesz were in “opposition” on the grounds that the “nation cannot be in opposition” (Bozóki 2012, 12). For this reason we’ve coded Fidesz 3 on OTH_POLCLASS from 2006 onward.\nDespite pursuing generally neo-liberal policies (Ádám 2018, 12), the financial elite have been a key element of the “elite” opposed to the ordinary people in Orbán’s populism. Ideologically, Fidesz has encouraged anti-capitalist sentiments at home (Bozóki 2012, 18; Enyedi 2016, 15), specifically by denouncing “speculative capitalism” as being an anti-Christian system through which “ordinary and trustworthy people always [turn] out as losers” (Hegedüs 2019, 414). The party has specifically opposed “liberal capitalist elites” (Hegedüs 2019, 413), “bankers” (Batory 2016, 290), “new aristocrats,” “opulent millionaires,” “loafers” and “swindlers,” for their exploitation of the Hungarian people (Enyedi 2016, 14). It seems that this rhetoric only really picked up in 2010 in the context of the financial crisis (Hegedüs 2019, 414). It also seems that it was particularly foreign financial institutions that were targeted in this way (Csigó and Merkovity 2016, 4), and after assuming government in 2010 the party enacted taxes specifically targeting multinational firms (Ádám 2018, 13), which were represented as ways to hurt banks and multinationals while sparing ordinary people (Bozóki 2012, 17). Nonetheless, domestic collaborators and beneficiaries of this global capitalist elite were also key enemies of the people in the party’s language (Csehi 2019, 1016; Enyedi 2016, 14). The dates and range of coding the party for OTH_FINANCIAL are difficult to determine, but on the balance of secondary evidence we’ve coded it 1 in the 2006 election and 3 from 2010.\nAccording to Palonen from 2002 onward the party’s representation of the “people” was in framed in ethnic terms (Palonen 2009, 329). It has employed ethnocentric ideas against external “enemies” (Fabry 2019, 175), specifically targeting several non-ethnic Hungarian “others” such as Roma, Muslims, Africans (L. Fekete 2016, 40), who have been targeted with “institutionalized racism” by the Fidesz government (Fabry 2019, 167). Against the ideals of multi-culturalism, Orbán has stressed the need to maintain ethnic homogeneity, as “too much mixing causes trouble” (Fabry 2019, 175). This ethnocentrism has included an antisemitic element (Becker 2010), which according to J. Szabó subtly “shapes current political propaganda of Orbán’s regime” (J. Szabó 2020, 32). This is often alleged to be a driving factor in the government’s fierce opposition to Hungarian-born Jewish billionaire George Soros (Kalmar 2020), who became a major element of the “elite” (Csehi 2019, 1017), and was accused of orchestrating the 2015 migrant crisis for profit (Kalmar 2020). The 2015 migrant crisis (see below) acted as a catalyst to sharpen the government’s rhetoric against ethnic others (Hegedüs 2019, 412), to the point that it started to match the more extreme Jobbik party in its ethnic nationalism (Palonen 2018, 317). We’ve therefore coded the party 2 on OTH_ETHNIC 2002-14, and then 3 after the migrant crisis (2018).\nAfter the 2015 migrant crisis, this ethno-nationalism was coupled with a strong opposition to immigrants, who were represented as cultural threats to Hungary and Europe (Palonen 2018, 317), and an “enemy” of the Hungarian people (Gonda 2019, 606). Orbán and Fidesz claimed that “migration will destroy us” (Lamour and Varga 2020, 342), that the crisis constituted an “invasion” of Muslims (L. Fekete 2016, 40), and that migrants were “waste” (Thorleifsson 2017, 318) hostile to the Hungarian people (Palonen 2018, 316). In government Fidesz installed billboards throughout the country stating that “The People have chosen: The country needs to be defended” to signal its unwillingness to accept migrants (Etl 2022, 3), and imposed laws punishing organizations accused of aiding illegal immigration with jail time (Fabry 2019, 175; Majtényi, Kopper, and Susánszky 2019). While this rhetoric clearly picked up from 2015, Majtényi (et al) make a convincing case that the party’s anti-immigrant rhetoric predates the crisis (Majtényi, Kopper, and Susánszky 2019, 179). For this reason we’ve coded it 2 on OTH_IMMIGRANTS from 2006-14 and 3 from 2018.\nForeign interests and states have been key elements of the “other” and the “elite” within Fidesz’s populist rhetoric. After his 2002 defeat Orbán started blaming opponents who served “foreign interests” (Bozóki 2012, 12), and he consistently alleged that opponents are activists attempting to enforce foreign “interests” on the Hungarian people (Johnson and Barnes 2015, 546; J. Szabó 2020, 31). For example, in 2014, he claimed that:\n\nwe had had enough of the politics that is forever concerned with how we might satisfy the West, the bankers, big capital and the foreign press . . . Over the past four years we have overcome that . . . subservient mentality . . . Hungary will not succumb again! (cited in Johnson and Barnes 2015, 536)\n\nWhile this category was often kept vague, the EU and the IMF have probably been the most important specific “external enemies” in Fidesz’s populist rhetoric (Gonda 2019, 606; Batory 2016, 289; Hargitai 2020, 203; Ádám and Bozóki 2011, 14; Csehi 2019, 1016). Orbán and the party have claimed, for example that: resistance to Brussels today is equivalent to resistance against Vienna and Moscow in previous chapters of the Hungarian nationalist story (Batory 2016, 290); that the EU was a colonial power in its interactions with Hungary (Csehi 2019, 1018); that Hungary was engaged in “a war of independence against the IMF” (Csehi 2019, 1018); and, after walking out of debt renegotiations in 2010, that Hungary would “not accept diktats” from the IMF or EU in the future because they were “not our bosses” (Fabry 2019, 173). Significantly for our coding definitions, numerous sources claim that this has reached the level of considering domestic political rivals to be puppets of these foreign actors (Hegedüs 2019, 415; Johnson and Barnes 2015, 551). In Enyedi’s words, “Ordinary Hungarians were typically not contrasted [by Fidesz] with the Hungarian elite, but rather with the international economic and cultural establishment and their local representatives: the ‘foreign-minded,’ cosmopolitan leftists and liberals” (Enyedi 2016, 14). This is sufficient to code the party consistently 3 on OTH_FOREIGN. We’ve seen no evidence for any rhetoric on the OTH_MILITARY scale (= 1).\nWhile the party has often had some left leaning economic policies (Toplišek 2020, 394; Palonen 2009, 322), it is usually considered to be a right-wing (Csigó and Merkovity 2016, 1) and “conservative-nationalist” party (Ádám and Bozóki 2011, 7). Where it should be placed within the right of the ideological spectrum is somewhat more difficult, as some have contended that is somewhat “moderate” (Boda et al. 2015, 876) and “centrist” (Palonen 2009, 325), and others a “hard right” party (Fabry 2019, 165) at various points in its history. On the whole its economic policy is generally liberal (Ádám 2018, 12), and we’ve coded it R on LRPOSITION, although this could be revisited.\nMost secondary sources identify Orbán’s political charisma and conclude that it has been a critical element of the party’s image and success (Körösényi 2019; Enyedi 2016, 2016; Ádám and Bozóki 2011, 3; Körösényi and Patkós 2017; Pappas 2016). As a party Fidesz has been “structured around its leader” (Lamour and Varga 2020, 336). In Bozóki’s interpretation, since 2003 he “transformed Fidesz from a democratic to a highly hierarchical, centralized party which is controlled exclusively by him”, and that “Orbán has not simply been an elected representative of Fidesz, it is Fidesz which belong to him and represent him” (Bozóki 2012, 17, 12). Similarly, Antal considers Orbán’s Hungary a case of “leader democracy” (Antal 2017, 11). This is sufficient evidence to code the party 3 on CHARISMA. Given that Orbán served as Prime Minster before 2006, we have coded Fidesz 3 on INSIDER for the entirety of its inclusion in the dataset.\nThe secondary literature has uniformly considered Fiedesz to be hostile to liberal democratic norms in that it is “authoritarian” (Ádám 2018), “autocratic” (Pappas 2019, 77), and directing Hungary on an illiberal and authoritarian “turn” in power (Bánkuti, Halmai, and Scheppele 2012; Ádám and Bozóki 2016, 104). Ideologically, Orbán has officially declared that “liberalism” was an enemy of the nation in 2014 (Hegedüs 2019, 416), specified a number of philosophical objections to it (which he considered different to democracy) (Scheppele 2019), and declared that his government would serve as a model alternative to Western liberal democracy (Toplišek 2020, 393). In Orbán’s words “the new state that we are constructing in Hungary is an illiberal state, a non-liberal state” (J. Szabó 2020, 31). This shift relates mostly to the constitutional changes which centralised power under the Fidesz government (L. Fekete 2016, 44). After winning a two-thirds supermajority in the 2010 election, Orbán used this control to give his parliamentary majority even more power, “effectively dismantling all checks and balances on executive power” (Ádám 2018, 12), and engaging in “unconventional moves limiting constitutional rights in Hungary” (J. Szabó 2020, 31). Bozóki has called this a “constitutional coup d’état” (Bozóki 2012, 17). In government the party has tried to force out judges opposed to its initiatives (Kornai 2015; L. Fekete 2016), curtailed the power of the constitutional court (Bozóki 2012, 17), and “undermin[ed] the institutional autonomy of the judiciary system” (Ádám and Bozóki 2011, 15). Constitutional reforms allowed Fidesz to nominate judges without parliamentary approval, after which it passed laws that the prior court would have struck down (Bánkuti, Halmai, and Scheppele 2012, 139). Regarding media freedom, government controlled media stations refused airtime for the opposition under Fidesz’s rule (Bozóki 2012, 17), and the government forced hundreds of private media owners to collectivise their outlets under the control of a state-linked entity led by a former Fidesz lawmaker (J. Szabó 2020, 33). The party also stacked state media with politically friendly managers (Bánkuti, Halmai, and Scheppele 2012, 141), and passed a law establishing the new “National Media and Info-communications Authority” with leadership elected by parliament (which was dominated by Fidesz at the time), which had carte blanch to regulate the media and fine journalists and institutions which print content which it deems “improper” content (Fabry 2019, 176). The Fidesz government has also created new security units that have acted as a “private army” for Orbán (Fabry 2019, 176), restricted the opposition’s capacity for mobilisation during elections (Palonen 2018, 315) and engaged in a ‘penal populism’ of adding minimum life sentences to habitual violent offenders (Boda et al. 2015). Before its second stint in government, Orbán criticised the legitimacy of the 2002 and 2006 elections, which Fidesz lost (Ádám 2019, 387). For these reasons many consider Hungary to no longer be a democracy under Orbán (Bozóki and Heged\\Hus 2018), and that the party has “washed away” the rule of law and threatens basic human rights (Csigó and Merkovity 2016, 299). For these reasons we’ve coded it 3 on LIBDEMNORMS from 2006."

    "text": "Movement for a Better Hungary/Jobbik\nJobbik is the successor of the “Right-Wing Youth Association” (Jobboldali Ifjúsági Közösség, JOBBIK) founded by a group of university students in 2002. The following year it officially became a party and changed its name while keeping its acronym to become “Movement for a Better Hungary” (note that the name is actually a play on words as “Jobb” means both “better” and “further to the right”). The new party formed an electoral alliance with MIÉP which received only 2.2% in the 2006 polls (A. Kovács 2013, 224). The following election in 2010 saw the party’s electoral breakthrough on its own, totalling almost 17% and winning the third largest number of seats in Parliament, following a similarly strong performance in EU elections the previous year. This occurred in the context of the economic crisis and a number of high profile crimes involving Roma perpetrators (Enyedi and Róna 2018, 255). Subsequent elections in 2014 and 2018 saw it reach 20% and 19% respectively, each time mobilising partially off its youth support and strong online presence (Kim 2016, 351; Karl 2017). Jobbik is considered by many to be the successor to the MEÍP on the far right (Kenes 2021, 5), and has claimed this itself (Tóth and Grajczjár 2015, 140). Its influence is widely seen to have pushed Fidesz further to the right in rhetoric and policy (Czibere and Kovách 2022, 738). Gábor Vona became leader of the party in 2006, but stepped down after failing to reach his target performance in the 2018 elections.\nA challenge with Jobbik is how to account for its changes over time. Around 2014-16, the party embarked on a cukisagkampany (‘cuteness campaign’) to moderate its image and broaden its appeal (Pirro 2019, 794) Vona claimed to be “killing the soul of Jobbik” in order to mature it” (Hyttinen 2022, 5), aiming to convert it into a centrist “people’s party” (Kenes 2021, 8). As a part of this strategy, Vona offered an apology to those who had been offended by earlier remarks (Metz and Oross 2020, 6), pledged not to make any more (including burning the EU flag) (Enyedi and Róna 2018, 264). The party then changed some of its policies on the EU (Kenes 2021, 8; Enyedi and Róna 2018, 264), started working with other parties in Parliament (Goldstein 2021, 28), and altered its rhetoric such that its “new slogans are not directed against anyone” (Hyttinen 2022, 14). It’s unclear exactly when this transition began, and therefore when it should be considered to have taken affect. Some say it emerged before the 2014 elections (Kenes 2021, 8), but most analysis suggests it only solidified after those elections (Lubarda 2020, 819–20), and took root in 2016 (Héjj 2017, 88; Metz and Oross 2020, 6), after an aberration back to nativist nationalism during the 2015 migrant crisis (Hyttinen 2022, 5). By 2018, a group frustrated with the transition split to form a rival party, Mi Hazánk (‘Our Homeland’) (Lubarda 2020, 819–20). Despite the change, the preponderance of the literature still considers the reformed Jobbik to be populist (Lubarda 2020, 820), albeit less violent nationalistic and ethnocentric, with some going as far as concluding the transition to be merely a “redecoration of a façade” (Héjj 2017, 89). Even Hyttinen, who considers the transition to be significant, considers the reformed party to be “a more flexible right-wing populism” (Hyttinen 2022, 23). Others have noted that: the shift did not lead the party to change its elite or membership (Dániel Kovarek et al. 2017, 66; Héjj 2017, 89); that changes mainly related to national level discourse, not the actions of local leaders (Dániel Kovarek et al. 2017, 78); that Vona still made efforts to tie the party to more extreme movements (Tóth and Grajczjár 2015, 137). We have concluded that the party has remained essentially populist through 2018, and that the changes should not alter any coding decisions for the 2018 elections, although this could be revisited.\nJobbik has been classed as an “anti-system party” (Enyedi and Róna 2018, 252). “anti-elite” (Enyedi and Róna 2018, 256; Bíró-Nagy, Boros, and Varga 2012, i), “Anti-corruption” (Pirro 2019, 792) and “anti-establishment” (Enyedi 2016, 17), the latter typified in its presence on the frontline of chaotic protests which followed the leaked speech of PM Gyurcsany in 2006 (Kenes 2021, 6; Kim 2016, 347). The party holistically blamed social grievances on “destructive behaviour of the political establishment” (Lugosi 2018, 223), which it articulated with what Pytlas calls a “conspiracy-like” framing (Pytlas 2013, 170). From its breakthrough 2010 election it specifically targeted “political criminals” (Pirro 2019, 794; Hyttinen 2022, 3) and “political crime” (Kenes 2021, 10), alleging that the political establishment betrayed the nation for the its own direct benefit (Pirro 2014b, 617). In Vona’s own words “Let’s be straight about it for once: they have deliberately and completely destroyed the country” (A. Kovács 2013, 226). This allegation is levelled against the entirety of the political establishment rather than just a few parties (Kim 2016, 349; Varga 2014, 795–96; Batory 2016, 296; Bíró-Nagy, Boros, and Vasali 2013, 238). In the words of Biro Nagy (et al.), Jobbik “continually alleges that the apparently controversial debates conducted between leading political forces are simply a front to conceal the fact that they are all in league with each other and operate in close-knit networks” (Bíró-Nagy, Boros, and Varga 2012, 4). As stated in the party’s 2010 Manifesto: “In Hungary the word ‘politician’ is now synonymous with the word ‘scoundrel’… Our goal is not merely the abolition of corruption, it is rather the cessation of the existence of politicians – as lawmakers – as being above the law” (cited in Kenes 2021, 10).\nOne of the elements of this attack on the political establishment was the claim that the post 1989 transition from communism was a “stolen transition” (Enyedi and Róna 2018, 263), and that the old communist elite is still in power (Bíró-Nagy, Boros, and Varga 2012, 2; A. Kovács 2013, 225–26), in league with other liberal newcomers (Lugosi 2018, 219). While Vona was once linked to Fidesz, from 2010 it too was considered by Jobbik to be part of the corrupt elite (Murer 2015, 87; Bíró-Nagy, Boros, and Varga 2012, 2–3; Héjj 2017, 90), becoming by 2014 the core of the “political establishment” (Pirro 2019, 794) only disguising itself as conservative (Tóth and Grajczjár 2015, 144). Vona claimed Orban only criticised Jobbik because “we do not want to prosecute only the red [Socialist], but also the orange [Fidesz] evildoers” (cited in Varga 2014, 802) This did not change after the party’s moderation from 2016. In the 2018 election for example, it’s posters showed Orbán and other Fidesz politicians with the caption: “they are stealing” (Héjj 2017, 90). In contrast to this elite, the party represented itself as a spontaneous manifestation of the people, in the words of one of its MPs: “The moment has arrived when people yearning for both justice and self-determination no longer await the arrival of change from politics, but rather they themselves effect change!” (cited in A. Kovács 2013, 226). This is more than sufficient evidence to show that the party reached 3 on the OTH_POLCLASS variable.\nFrom its foundation Jobbik has been a “nativist” (Borbáth and Gessler 2021), “ultra-nationalistic” (Thorleifsson 2021, 188) “openly racist” (Hyttinen 2022, 3), and “xenophobic” (Lubarda 2020, 819) party with an explicitly ethnocentric idea of the Hungarian nation (Bozóki and Cueva 2021, 111), including ethnic Hungarians living in neighbouring states (Lázár 2015, 229) and excluding Roma and Jews (Ádám and Bozóki 2016, 106; Enyedi and Róna 2018, 256). The party’s motto is “Hungary for Hungarians” (Ilikova and Tushev 2020, 329) and its manifestos have shown “strong traces of overt racism” (Lugosi 2018, 225). Hostility toward Roma peoples has been the most important element of this (Ilikova and Tushev 2020, 329; Pirro 2014b, 616; Bíró-Nagy, Boros, and Vasali 2013, 234). Exploiting a number of high profile crimes committed by Roma (Pirro 2014b, 255), Jobbik has mainstreamed the narrative of cigánybűnözés (“Gypsy crime”) (Pirro 2019, 792), and “Gypsy terror” (Tóth and Grajczjár 2015, 138), to the extent of claiming that Roma were genetically predisposed to be criminals (Kenes 2021, 13; Kyriazi 2016, 2533). More than any other issue, the struggle conflict between the Roma and non-Roma was placed at “the heart of its political struggle” in its breakthrough years (A. Kovács 2013, 225). Roma are also target on welfare chauvinist grounds as lazy and unworthy of state benefits (Dániel Kovarek et al. 2017, 68), and “parasites” on the nation (Kyriazi 2016, 2534). The party has “called for a policy of forced assimilation” (Pirro 2014b, 616). Though some consider the party in 2010 to be less antisemitic than the MIEP (Pirro 2019, 792; Szabados 2015, 49), antisemitism has still been a core part of the party’s narrative in the era of its electoral success (Murer 2015, 80; A. Kovács 2013, 227; Ádám and Bozóki 2011, 15; Thorleifsson 2021, 197). Speeches my Jobbik MPs, for example, show that many party leaders “consider the Gypsies to be tools in the hands of Zionist conspirators against the Hungarian nation” (Enyedi 2016, 17). Jobbik was originally very favourable to Islam, but made a U-turn on this after the migrant crisis (Thorleifsson 2021; Dániel Kovarek et al. 2017). At this point the party started to engage in anti-Islam narratives about crime and radicalism. “Softening” this nativist rhetoric has been a major component of the party’s image chance since 2014-16 (Ilikova and Tushev 2020, 329; Palonen 2018, 317). According to some analysis this was in response to Fidesz embracing such rhetoric (Hyttinen and Näre 2017). However, while the party began to distance itself from its most radical elements, many of its members did not (Kenes 2021, 15), particularly at the local level (Dániel Kovarek et al. 2017, 78), and Borbáth and Gessler claim that any shift in this rhetoric was re-elevated by the 2018 election (Borbáth and Gessler 2021, 13). While there may be an argument that the party should be coded 2 on OTH_ETHNIC in 2018, on the balance of evidence we’ve kept this at 3 throughout.\nJobbik has also engaged in “anti-immigrant” rhetoric (Ilikova and Tushev 2020, 239). As with Fidesz, the story here is different before and after the 2015 migrant crisis. Before it, immigration was an “insignificant” issue (Szabados 2015, 54), and Jobbik focused very little on immigration compared to other far-right parties (Bíró-Nagy, Boros, and Vasali 2013, 231; Dániel Kovarek et al. 2017, 72). However a number of sources mention that it warned of the potential threat of migration coming from the recently enlarged EU (Pirro 2019, 792), and according to Szabados it organised a “hate campaign” against Chinese immigrants, whom it accused of stealing jobs, and destroying local businesses (Szabados 2015, 54). Because of this we’ve coded it 2 on OTH_IMMIGRANT in 2010 and 2014. After the migrant crisis, immigrants were elevated to be a key “other” in Jobbik’s discourse (Kovarek et al. 2017, 72), when “Inflammatory imagery, rhetoric and antimigrant sentiments were heavily present in [its] online campaigns, newsletters and internet debates” (Thorleifsson 2021, 195). One Jobbik mayor formed a “migrant hunter” militia and officially banned Muslims from entering his village in 2016 (Dániel Kovarek et al. 2017, 64), and some have claimed that the party has been trying to out-do Fidesz on anti-immigrant toughness (Szabados 2015, 55). We’ve therefore coded the party 3 on OTH_IMMIGRANT in 2018.\nJobbik has been described as “anti-banking” (Murer 2015, 79) and “anti-capitalist” (Pirro 2019, 792; Kenes 2021, 5). Party leaders have clarified that they are not against the market system totally, but just the “excessive economic liberalism” that Hungary got “lured” into after 1990 (Goldstein 2021, 27), and that they favour small and medium sized Hungarian owned businesses (Bíró-Nagy, Boros, and Varga 2012, 798). Foreign multinational firms, however, are a key enemy of the Hungarian people (Bíró-Nagy, Boros, and Vasali 2013, 238; Tóth and Grajczjár 2015, 141), and the party has advocated confiscating assets owned by foreign investors and handing them to Hungarians (Tóth and Grajczjár 2015, 141). Kovarek describes the party’s narrative thusly: “lobby groups financed by international capital, through their local lackeys, are executing their plot to destroy nations and indigenous values” (Dániel Kovarek et al. 2017, 68). This hostility is in many instances bound together with the party’s antisemitic discourse (Dániel Kovarek et al. 2017, 68). It is mainly foreign financial elites who are target here, but some sources refer to the fact that Jobbik “presented the rich elite and the banks… as a threat to society” (Vratislav Havlík 2012, 148–49). We’ve therefore coded Jobbik 3 on the OTH_FINANCIAL variable.\nJobbik has also focussed heavily on foreign and “colonizing” global elites as enemies of the Hungarian people (A. Kovács 2013, 226). It has articulated a narrative whereby a global elite is attempting to eradicate the nation as the foundation of human community” (cited in Ádám and Bozóki 2016, 109). Vona voiced hostility to Western (particularly American and Isreali) interests and fidelity to Eastern (Russian, Iranian) ones (A. Kovács 2013, 228). While this narrative is somewhat vague (and relates to global capital as well as foreign states), Jobbik has been particularly opposed to the EU and NATO. Party members have burnt the EU flag and threw one from a Parliamentary window (Lázár 2015, 230; Ádám and Bozóki 2016, 110), and according to Bíró Nagy (et al), the party “attributed almost every negative trend in Hungary to the supposed background machinations of the EU.” (Bíró-Nagy, Boros, and Vasali 2013, 240). It has accused NATO of “serving American interests unconditionally” (Murer 2015, 93), and developed irredentist positions regarding Hungary’s neighbours (Pirro 2014b, 614). Domestic rivals have routinely been seen as lackeys and representatives of this global elite. In Bíró Nagy (et al)’s words, “Jobbik’s rhetoric has thus right from the start sought to portray national politics as serving international interests” (Bíró-Nagy, Boros, and Varga 2012, 4). There is evidence that since the party’s 2014-16 moderation its positions regarding the EU have changed (Hyttinen 2022, 11), but as with the prior categories, it remains to be seen whether the party’s general discourse regarding foreign elites had shifted fundamentally in 2018, hence we’ve coded it 3 on OTH_FOREIGN. We’ve not seen any evidence of OTH_MILITARY rhetoric (= 1).\nJobbik has been consistently placed on the “extreme right” (Ádám and Bozóki 2011, 15) “radical right-wing” (Tóth and Grajczjár 2015, 133), “far right” (Ádám and Bozóki 2016, 99; Kyriazi 2016, 2531), “ultra-right” (Ilikova and Tushev 2020, 328) end of the spectrum, and often considered either “neo-fascist” (Becker 2010, 29) or “blatantly fascist” (Bíró-Nagy, Boros, and Vasali 2013, 238) owing to its militant nationalism. However scholars have long noted the gulf between the party’s economic policy and its cultural politics, the former being left-leaning and the latter far right (Bíró-Nagy, Boros, and Varga 2012, 5). The party claims to advocate “a stronger role of the state in the economy, redistribution of wealth and a revision of privatization contracts” (Pirro 2014b, 615; see also Tóth and Grajczjár 2015, 142; Lugosi 2018), and has been notably more economically interventionist in its policies than Fidesz. Despite this, the rejection of the pre-1990 communist economy is a “cornerstone of its identity” (Bíró-Nagy, Boros, and Varga 2012, 2; see also Dániel Kovarek et al. 2017, 71; Héjj 2017, 84). After its transition in 2014-16, it started to define itself as “centrist” (Lubarda 2020, 819), or “modern conservative” (Kenes 2021, 10). As with the above categories, we’ve erred on the side of leaving its coding consistent rather than changing it for the 2018 election (LRPOSITION = FR).\nA handful of texts on Jobbik have noted that Gabor Vona has been a “dynamic” (Tóth and Grajczjár 2015, 136) and “charismatic” leader of the party (Hyttinen 2022, 3), and a “great orator” (Metz and Oross 2020, 6). Sources also note that the party organisation was largely centralised under his control during his tenure (Metz and Oross 2020, 13–14). However, references to the significance of Vona’s charisma and persona to the image of Jobbik are notably rare compared to secondary literature about other populist parties, and some clearly refute the idea that the party is a one-man show (Havlík 2012, 144). While his leadership was clearly important to the party’s success after 2006, we’ve not concluded that this reached the highest level on our CHARISMA coding, and hence we’ve coded the party 2 here. Though he was once close to Orban (Szabados 2015, 49), neither Vona nor Jobbik has ever served in government (INSIDER = 1).\nJobbik has consistently threatened liberal democratic norms. Ideologically, it has joined Fidesz in declaring its opposition to liberal democracy (which they called “refuse imported from abroad”) with a system in which the state is ideologically engaged in the support of the Hungarian ethnic majority (Enyedi 2016, 12). It has also questioned the fundamental merits of democracy (Bíró-Nagy, Boros, and Vasali 2013, 232), and many Jobbik leaders “reject democracy entirely” (Enyedi and Róna 2018, 264). Its most significant threat to liberal democratic norms however is its relationship with paramilitary violence (Kenes 2021, 8). In 2007 Vona created the Magyar Gárda, or “Hungarian Guard”, as a paramilitary organisation loyal to Jobbik and active at its rallies (Ádám and Bozóki 2016, 106; Thorleifsson 2021, 188; Szabados 2015, 49). Created to “restore law and order” (Pirro 2019, 793), the group has sported paraphernalia associated with the Arrow Cross fascist movement active in the Second World War (Ilikova and Tushev 2020, 329). It was disbanded by court order in 2009, but has reformed under various new names and long remained linked to Jobbik (Murer 2015, 88; Kim 2016, 348). Jobbik militias like this have demonstrated against alleged “gypsy terror” (Feischmidt and Szombati 2017), throwing bottles and rocks at homes believed to be owned by Roma (Murer 2015, 89). According to numerous studies, the founding of the Magyar Gárda constituted the “real breakthrough” that facilitated Jobbik’s subsequent electoral success (Bíró-Nagy, Boros, and Vasali 2013, 229; see also Varga 2014, 794). This is more than sufficient to code Jobbik 3 on LIBDEMNORMS."

    "text": "Politics Can Be Different\n“Politics Can be Different” (Lehet Más a Politika, LMP) was a green party founded in 2008 by a collection of activists led by András Schiffer. It built on the legacy of prior green movements, especially the Protect the Future movement (Tóth 2015), and succeeded in part due to the left wing void in the political system in the 2010 election where it won 7% of the vote (Daniel Mikecz 2017, 359). In its first term in Parliament the party split on the question of how much to cooperate with the other anti-Orbán parties in the run up to the 2014 election. Some MPs favoured cooperation at the expense of the party’s original anti-party independence, whereas the official party chose to remain non-aligned for the election (see Tóth 2015). Despite losing the former faction, the maintained its presence in parliament (with 5%) and improved again in 2018 under the leadership of Ákos Hadházy.\nLMP is occasionally considered non-populist in the literature (Csigó and Merkovity 2016, 2), in part due to its “intellectual style discourse” that was in stark contrast to Orbán and Fidesz (Tóth 2015, 247), and its related image of being “too professional” in the eyes of many voters (Glied 2014, 50). It also engaged after 2010 in a “constructive and halfhearted oppositional role” (Tóth 2015, 248), and included a socially inclusive message that contrasted with the völkisch nationalism of other populist (Lubarda 2020, 824). Despite this, the description of the party’s message in the literature paints a clear picture of populist discourse as we have defined it. This message was “anti-elitist” (Vratislav Havlík 2012, 136), “anti-party” (Sitter 2011, 260), “anti-establishment” (Dániel Mikecz 2015, 103; Engler 2020; Pirro and Della Porta 2021, 440), and “strongly anti-corruption” (Vratislav Havlík 2012, 138). It claimed that all other established parties were corrupt (Sitter 2011, 260), including those on the left (Daniel Kovarek and Littvay 2019, 574), offering itself (as its name suggests) as a complete renewal of the democratic process in the interests of ordinary people (Vratislav Havlík 2012, 141). The party’s campaigns portrayed a country in ruin due to the ruling elite’s internal power struggles in pursuit of self-interests, hidden behind the mere façade of representative democracy (Tóth 2015, 237; Vratislav Havlík 2012, 150). Despite its professional image, it nonetheless described the political situation in “apocalyptic” terms (Tóth 2015, 237). In Fábián’s synopsis:\n\nLMP’s critique of the existing political, economic and social order is extensive. Most importantly, LMP sees itself as an anti-party, standing outside and above the existing Hungarian political structure that it considers corrupt, self-serving and obstructing the creation of a meaningful democracy (Fábián 2010, 1008).\n\nAlongside its green and progressive policy agenda, the party ramped up its anti-corruption message under the leadership of Hadházy, who was a former Fidesz city councillor who left the ruling party as a corruption whistle-blower (Pirro and Della Porta 2021, 443). In the 2018 elections, for example, LMP campaigns featured slogans that reduced political problems to elite corruption, such as ‘Against stealing: LMP’ or ‘Those who stole are going to jail!’ (cited in Daniel Kovarek and Littvay 2019, 576). We have considered this sufficient evidence to code the party 3 on OTH_POLCLASS, although its professional and occasionally “constructive” image may make a case for this to be 2.\nThe LMP’s green progressive agenda pitted it against both global capitalism and multinational firms (Fábián 2010, 1008), especially monopolies (Lubarda 2020, 822). According to Havlík, it claimed that the parties that remained in parliament were controlled by economic oligarchs (Vratislav Havlík 2012, 150) (OTH_FINANCIAL = 3). This also had an anti-foreign dimension, with foreign ownership of assets (Lubarda 2020, 823), the EU, and international corporations targeted in the LMP’s discourse (Fábián 2010, 1007). This appears not to have reached the point of arguing that foreign interests control the elite, hence OTH_FOREIGN = 2.\nIn contrast to other Hungarian populist parties, LMP did not have an ethnocentric definition of the people, their “others,” or the elite. For example, it was notably progressive regarding the integration of Romani into Hungarian society (Vratislav Havlík 2012, 149) (OTH_ETHNIC = 1). Likewise, even after the 2015 migrant crisis significantly impacted the discourse of other parties, LMP “did not take a stand” on migration in the 2018 elections (Daniel Kovarek and Littvay 2019, 575) (OTH_IMMIGRANT = 1). We also could not find any evidence of OTH_MILITARY discourse (= 1).\nPositioning LMP on a left-right ideological axis is very difficult. The core if its initial outlook was in green politics, identifying itself as an “ökopárt” (party of ecology) (Fábián 2010, 1007), and its leadership deliberately positioned itself beyond left and right wing viewpoints (Fábián 2015, 332; Dániel Mikecz 2015, 103). In that capacity it has been called “eco-libertarian” (Becker 2010, 34), and “agrarian populist” (Lubarda 2020, 822). However most sources claim that the party’s policies were generally “left leaning” (see Tóth 2015, 232; Glied 2014, 39), in relation to both economic and social policy (Vratislav Havlík 2012, 149), and that it appealed mainly to left-leaning voters in its initial election (Fábián 2010, 1007). Later sources however suggest that the party’s leadership pulled the party to the centre (Engler 2020; S. Fekete and Fazekas 2018, 164), or even the centre-right (Lubarda 2020, 812). Based on the above we’ve coded the party L on LRPOSITION in 2010 and 2014, and CL in 2018.\nNumerous sources stress that under Schiffer leadership the LMP did not “present charismatic leading figures” that could personify its message (Tóth 2015, 256; Glied 2014, 50; Papp and Zorigt 2016), in part due to its insistence on avoiding centralised leadership structures (Vratislav Havlík 2012, 145; Vratislav Havlík and Pinková 2012, 290). The party’s messaging became somewhat more personalised under Hadházy and the LMP Prime Minster candidate Bernadett Szél (Daniel Kovarek and Littvay 2019, 576), but not to the point of registering on the CHARISMA variable, hence we have coded it as 1 consistently. The party and its leaders have never been central figures in government (Hadházy was only a local representative when he was in Fidesz until 2013) (INSIDER = 1). Party members have occasionally considered their politics as “revolutionary”, but not to the extent of advocating system change (Tóth 2015, 241). In fact the party had a strong “rule of law” focus and joined the fight against Orbán’s illiberal reforms after 2010 (Vratislav Havlík 2012, 149–51) (LIBDEMNORMS = 1)."

However the movement was more of an “umbrella” movement of various factions (Palonen 2018, 313), only some of which appear populist (specifically that of István Csurka which went on to become the MIÉP). Its leader Józef Antall does not appear to have used populist rhetoric himself.

    "text": "The Muhajir Qaumi Movement (MQM), which in 1997 changed its name to the Muttahida Quami Movement, represents the “Muhajirs” (“migrants” or “refugees”) in Pakistan – Urdu-speaking Muslim immigrants who moved to Pakistan (primarily to the Sindh province and Karachi in particular) from various “Muslim minority” parts of India after partition. With roots in the Muhajir student organisation from the 1970s, the party emerged as a political force out of the 1985-86 ethnic riots in Karachi under the charismatic leadership of Altaf Hussain, appealing primarily to second generation Muhajirs, more open to ethno-nationalism than their parents (Malik 1995, 51). Initially supported and armed by military ruler Zia ul-Huq in the 1980s as a spoiler to the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) in Sindhi (M. A. Shah 1998, 508), the MQM subsequently formed alliances with both major parties over its three decades. After it embraced violence against state and military officials in the early 1990s, “Operation Clean-up” targeted its leadership forcing Hussain into exile in London from which he has never returned. The party has had several offshoots against Hussain’s leadership, including the unsuccessful MQM-Haqiqi faction and more recently the so-called MQM-Pakistan, however the only MQM parties to poll over 5% in national elections are those that Hussain has led. After a heavily-criticised speech in 2016 in which he called Pakistan a “cancer for the whole world”, Hussain’s effectively lost control of the party and its fortunes plummeted in the subsequent 2018 elections.\nThe MQM claims that Muhajir’s have been the victims of systematic oppression and disloyalty by successive Pakistani governments since independence. In Altaf Hussain’s words: “What has been done in twenty years by the government? […] The faces change, but the policies remain the same” (Baloch 2012, 6). And in another speech: “We are left with half-achieved independence. Muslims got the country, but we are still slaves. Before it was the foreigners, the colonialists and today we are slaves to our own people” (Baloch 2012, 7). The MQM claimed that it had diverged from traditional “drawing room politics” of the other major parties by truly representing the excluded poor (Waseem 1996, 625). It also claims that a feudal “privileged class” runs Pakistan, and that the party sought to “end the rule of the 2%, and create the rule of the 98% (Richards 1994, 307–8; see also Schied 2001, 34). The policy background was the establishment of the quota system that sought to make appointments to the civil service (in which Muhajir’s had been highly overrepresented) more equally distributed. While Muhajirs were overrepresented in the state bureaucracy in the early decades after independence, various quota systems have made it more difficult for them to get jobs in the federal and provincial bureaucracy (Haq 1995, 992). The MQM has repeatedly claimed that this system was a deliberate strategy to marginalise Muhajirs, especially young and relatively poor. It also claimed that the decision not move the capital from Karachi to Islamabad in 1958 was a done deliberately to marginalise Muhajirs (Haq 1995, 991). For this reason we have coded OTH_POLCLASS at 3 for each election.\nMQM discourse emphasised (and arguably created) the concept of Muhajir as an ethnic identity, and positioned itself as the exclusive defender of that communities interests (Naqvi 2020; Shahzad 2013; M. A. Shah 1998, 510). At its peak this included demands for a separate province to be carved out of Sindh as a formal homeland necessary “for their [Muhajir’s] very survival” (Schied 2001, 36). In championing the Muhajir cause the MQM’s rhetoric frequently asserted that other ethnic groups were essentially antagonistic to Muhajir interests. This targeted Pakistan’s biggest ethnic bloc, Punjabis, (K. M. Shah and Sareen 2019, 7; Schied 2001, 32) and especially the Sindhis and Pashtuns in and around Karachi and Hyderabad, all of whom were frequent “others” to the Muhajir identity as portrayed in MQM discourse. By the late 1990s the party attempted to moderate its ethnocentric image, including changing the meaning of “MQM” to Mutahida Qaumi Movement (United National Movement) (Haq 1995, 1001). By some accounts this was part of a significant strategy to shift from an ethnocentric party limited to Urban Sindh to a broader middle class movement. However the available evidence suggests that this was not a substantial shift, as the party’s demands, rhetoric and leadership remained essentially unchanged (Schied 2001, 39), and it was ultimately “unable to transition to non-ethnic politics” (K. M. Shah and Sareen 2019, 14) (OTH_ETHNIC = 3).\nOne of Hussain and the MQM’s key political targets has been the Pakistani military, which it has accused the military of genocide against Muhajirs (Haq 1995, 1001). Hussain has also associated the higher ranks of the armed forces with the core of the corrupt political system: “we must not forget the Generals. Lest we forget, they remain the real oppressors today” (Baloch 2012, 7). In contrast to the sacrifice of the Muhajir migration, he portrays the military elite of being “wealthy but devoid of moral fibre and patriotism” (Waseem 1996, 628; see also Schied 2001, 36). Hostility to the military became especially strong after the army’s terror violent Operation Clean-up in 1992 (Ahmar 1996, 1035). According to Baloch, it was only after this that Hussain started to directly criticise the military. For this reason, we’ve coded OTH_MILITARY 1 for the 1988 election and 3 from 1993. Despite claiming to represent the poor, the MQM was “policy neutral” on key economic matters (Waseem 1996, 626), perhaps in part due to the fact that may Muhajirs were well established in the business community (OTH_FINANCIAL = 1). We’ve seen no evidence that OTH_FOREIGN sentiment features in the party’s discourse (= 1).\nIronically, even though the MQM’s mission is to represents migrants from outside of Pakistan, and has consistently advocated for the increased immigration of Muslim’s from other parts of India and Bangladesh (“stranded Pakistanis”) (Shahzad 2013, 133), it has often engaged in nativist anti-immigrant politics targeting immigrants from other places (Waseem 1996, 626). This has focussed especially Pashtuns from Afghanistan and non-Muhajir Pakistanis into urban Karachi and Hyderabad (Schied 2001, 40). It’s early charters demanded that only citizens (or “real Sindhis”) be able to vote, own businesses and buy property (Shahzad 2013, 133), and that Afghan refugees be deported ack to Afghanistan (Haq 1995, 998). Later on, it claimed that the influx of Pashtuns into Karachi signified the Taliban’s “taking over” the city (K. M. Shah and Sareen 2019, 14) (OTH_IMMIGRANTS = 3). The MQM is very difficult to pin down on a left-right ideological spectrum. It is at once “ideologically agnostic” (Waseem 1996, 626), a self-proclaimed champion of the poor, yet a “fascist leaning” (Newberg 1994) party of violent ethno-nationalism. Given that the latter of these best describes the party’s core discourse and activities, we’ve coded it FR on LRPOSITION, but this could be further scrutinised.\nAltaf Hussain gained complete control over the organisation from 1987, and became known as quaid (“the leader”) and Pir Sahib (“spiritual guide”) (Haq 1995, 997). The MQM created a “cult of personality” around him, promoting an explicit doctrine of “blind faith” in its leader (Waseem 1996, 625; Naqvi 2020, 81; see also Malik 1995; Schied 2001, 43; Gayer 2003, 21; Baloch 2012). Most scholars consider the MQM agenda to have been solely set by him (Ahmar 1996, 1043; N. Khan 2010, 108), and even after fleeing to London he still addressed party meetings by phone (Haq 1995, 1002). This is sufficient to code the party 3 on CHARISMA.\nSince its emergence from the riots of the 1980s, the MQM has been a fundamentally violent movement (Ahmar 1996, 1037; Shahzad 2013; N. Khan 2010; Abid 2017; M. A. Shah 1998, 511). MQM rallies have explicitly advocated violence, and even been used to distribute weapons (N. Khan 2010, 68). It has also violently harassed and intimidated critical journalists, (Haq 1995, 1002–3; Waseem 1996, 627; Ahmar 1996, 1034; Malik 1995, 66; Shahzad 2013, 145), extorted Karachi businesses into donating to the movement (Haq 1995, 1002–3), and violently clamped down on internal dissent against Hussain’s leadership and non-MQM Muhajirs who were seen as a threat for not supporting the party (K. M. Shah and Sareen 2019, 9). Party workers have abducted and tortured military officers (Waseem 1996, 627), While these activities probably peaked during the violent periods of the late 1980s and 1990s, the party’s use of violence continued through the 2000s (Siddiqui 2022, 2), although Khan (N. Khan 2010, 75) claims that it has went somewhat “underground”. For these reasons we have consistently coded the party 3 on LIBDEMNORMS. Given that the party was a part of a power sharing agreement with the PP after its first election in 1988, we have coded it 1 on INSIDER for that election, and 2 for subsequent elections.\nNote that in 1988, MQM candidates officially participated as independents, and in 1990-97 they were officially called the “Haq Parast Group” (HPG) (Dawn 2018). Despite this, the secondary literature universally refers to both election groups as MQM, and there should be no doubt that this is the same party."

    "text": "Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf\nPakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) was formed in 1996, by cricketer Imran Khan. As one of the country’s most identifiable sports personalities during the 1980s and 1990s, Khan entered the political realm via his philanthropic endeavors. While the party did not gain any momentum in its first decade, during the military regime of Perves Musharraf (1999-2008) Khan became a feature on political talk shows, often criticising Musharraf’s pro-US actions during the War on Terror, and maligning the political class for its corruption (Yılmaz and Shakil 2021, 7). After boycotting the 2008 election (in protest of Musharraf’s decision not to stand down), PTI first emerged electorally in 2013, winning 17% of the vote mainly from middle and upper classes mobilised through newly available electronic media avenues. By emerging as the favoured candidate of the military, and benefitting from high profile corruption scandals in 2016-17, Khan and the PTI took almost 32% of the vote in the 2018 election and formed government.\nThe core political theme of the PTI is Khan’s “aggressive anti-corruption crusade” (Faiz 2022b, 55; see also A. Shah 2019, 129; Javid and Mufti 2022, 77; Mulla 2017, 4185; Javid 2019, 11; Rastogi 2021, 3). He developed an “anti-politics” discourse (Evans 2012, 221) which describes the elite as a “corrupt mafia ruling over Pakistan” (Faiz 2022b, 59; Shakil and Yilmaz 2021, 6), and (in the party’s manifestos) as “inept, corrupt and selfish politicians, feudals, civil and military bureaucrats with vested interests” who have “plundered” the nation (T. M. Khan 2020, 66; see also Sheikh 2018, 110). Repatriating money stolen from the national coffers, Khan suggested, would finance the “new (naya) Pakistan”, prosperous and free of corruption (Shakil and Yilmaz 2021, 8). An essential element of this narrative is that the two major parties (the Pakistani People’s Party/PPP and the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz/PML-N) were equally culpable in creating and benefitting from this corrupt order. He has accused PPP and PML-N of engaging in a muq muqa, (“nefarious deal” in Punjabi slang), in which they acted as each other’s faux opposition, taking turns in government and partaking in the same forms of corruption (T. M. Khan 2020, 60; Faiz 2022b, 56). The Panama Papers leaks in 2016, which revealed the offshore holdings of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s family, gave this campaign a significant boost before the 2018 election (Faiz 2022b, 59). Several scholars (T. M. Khan 2020; Javid and Mufti 2022, 78) have noted that that the party shifted away from its mass-party organisational approach between 2013 and 2018 elections in order to build coalitions with other “electables” (politicians whose wealth, connections, and land ownership enabled them to win local contests) and therefore form government. However, there is no indication that this altered the party’s or Khan’s discourse in the latter election. Therefore, we have coded OTH_POLCLASS as 3 for the duration.\nThe military relationship with PTI is somewhat complicated. In his early years of political engagement Khan was often critical of the military’s actions, especially during the Musharraf regime. This included “severe criticism” Musharraf’s (military) regime and strong opposition to the military’s cooperation with the US War on Terror, positions which “did not endear him to the military establishment” (T. M. Khan 2020, 64). But in a deeper sense the PTI was always connected to the military establishment (Faiz 2022b, 55), with which he shared a common interpretation of Pakistan’s problems (T. M. Khan 2020, 64). Early manifestos of the PTI were noticeably silent on the subject of the military’s intervention in politics (Sheikh 2018, 110). Shah (A. Shah 2019, 130) claims that “Khan always omits Pakistan’s decidedly unaccountable military from his boasts about holding politicians accountable,” and it is commonplace among scholars to assert that the military establishment had a hand in ensuring that the PTI won the 2018 elections instead of the PPP or PML-N (A. Shah 2019, 129; Faiz 2022b; Javid and Mufti 2022). In government, Khan espoused a narrative of “unprecedented civil-military harmony” (Faiz 2022b, 62). For this reason, we’ve coded the PTI as 1 on OTH_MILITARY.\nOpposition to foreign interference in Pakistan has been a strong theme in Khan and the PTI’s discourse, particularly regarding the United States (Evans 2012, 221; A. Shah 2019, 131; Mulla 2017, 4187; Yılmaz and Shakil 2021, 8). The American use of drones in the War on Terror, many instances of which occurred in northwest Pakistan and included high civilian casualties, drew fierce criticism from Khan. According to Shakil and Yilmaz, this reached a proportion in which ” ‘the West’ and its supporters were deemed the antagonistic and conspiring other” (Shakil and Yilmaz 2021, 7). India has also featured as a foreign power behind the status quo in Khan’s rhetoric (Faiz 2022b, 60; Shakil and Yilmaz 2021, 9). According to Yilmaz and Shakil (Yılmaz and Shakil 2021, 11) he has openly accused his critics of being “agents of ‘India’s fascist government’”, and accused the national elite of making Pakistan a “puppet state” and a “slave” to the west and its financial institutions (particularly the IMF) (Shakil and Yilmaz 2021, 8). There may be some debate about whether this consistently reaches the highest level on the OTH_FOREIGN scale, but on the balance of evidence we’ve coded the party 3. The literature does not present any evidence that PTI or Khan engaged in an ethnocentric politics (OTH_ETHNIC = 1). Likewise, there is no evidence of any discourse against financial elites (OTH_FINANCIAL = 1) or immigrants (OTH_IMMIGRANTS = 1).\nAlmost all articles on the PTI’s rise emphasis how Khan’s charisma was essential to its meaning in the eyes of voters (see Javid and Mufti 2022, 68; Mulla 2017, 4184; Shakil and Yilmaz 2021, 11). This was especially true for its early elections when the PTI was totally synonymous with Khan (T. M. Khan 2020, 63; Yilmaz and Shakil 2021, 5). The party’s use of social media was one of the factors that allowed Khan’s personality to connect directly with voters in an unmediated way (Javid and Mufti 2022, 81; Mulla 2017; Faiz 2022b, 58). The literature does not suggest that there Khan and the PTI consistently espoused any consistent economic ideology with political salience, but was rather an “amalgamation of piecemeal ideologies” (Yılmaz and Shakil 2021, 10; see also Khalid 2020). The reason why Khan and the PTI are usually considered “right wing” (Faiz 2022b, 55; A. Shah 2019, 128) or “centre-right” (Sheikh 2018, 109) has to do more with its embrace of cultural conservatism and nationalism. Khan is has consistently portrayed himself as a religious conservative, and a major part of his public identity before starting PTI in 1996 was a shift away from his former playboy lifestyle and an embrace of a devout form of Islam after the death of his mother (Shakil and Yilmaz 2021, 6; A. Shah 2019, 131; Faiz 2022b, 57). He has often vilified liberal and progressive intellectuals for seeing Pakistan through a “westernised lens” (Yılmaz and Shakil 2021, 9; see also Faiz 2022b, 57; Shakil and Yilmaz 2021, 9). For this reason we’ve coded PTI as R on LRPOSITION.\nKhan was notable among major politicians for expressing solidarity with the Taliban, whom he labelled “freedom fighters” (T. M. Khan 2020, 64). The Tehrik Taliban Pakistan even nominated Khan to be their representative in negotiations with the government 2014, which he declined (Faiz 2022b, 57). Evidence suggests that media freedoms were curtailed during the PTI’s time in government (Hussain, Abbas, and Sheikh 2022; Mulla 2017), and Faiz contends that, Khan abused anti-corruption authorities to target opposition politicians (Faiz 2022b, 56). After losing the 2013 election, Khan discredited electoral institutions, claiming that a number of state bodies (including the judiciary) had rigged him of victory (Faiz 2022b, 58; A. Shah 2019, 131; Javid and Mufti 2022, 80; Cheema, Chacko, and Gul 2019, 32). These are all violations of liberal democratic standards, but given the context of Pakistani politics we find that this doesn’t quite reach the threshold of 3 on LIBDEMNORMS (= 2). As Khan had not served in government prior to 2018 PTI is coded 1 on INSIDER.\nNot included\nPakistan People’s Party\nThe Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) is often considered a populist party in its early years under the leadership of Zulifkar Ali Bhutto (Jones 2020; Shafqat 2020, 25; Ayoob 1985, 157; Nasr 1996, 259). This includes its first period in government in the mid-1970s. Bhutto, a charismatic student leader and cabinet minister in the 1960s, led a mass movement to overthrow the military rule of Gen Ayub Khan in 1969, going on to institute a relatively reformist period in power before being overthrown by the military in 1977 and executed in 1979. The PPP has formed government several times since 1980, including two prime ministerial stints under Bhutto’s daughter and successor Benazir Bhutto (1988-90, 1993-96), and another between 2008 and 2013 under Yousaf Gillani and Raja Ashraf. Benazir’s husband Asif Ali Zadari also served as president between 2008 and 2013, following the former’s assassination in 2007.\nThere is a strong case that the rhetoric of the elder Bhutto’s campaigns in the 1970s constitute populist discourse by our definitions. However the available evidence suggest that following this period the PPP became a more mundane and patronage-based party (Jones 2020; Faiz 2022a). Benazir Bhutto’s 1980s and 1990s campaigns saw her “court” military leadership rather than antagonising it (Newberg 1994, 168), and the extent of populist sentiment appears to be the evocation of the legacy of her father (Syed 1991), and reformist policy proscriptions were significantly softened (Rais 1989, 205). More recently the PPP has acted as a mainstream party, even when in opposition. In Faiz’s interpretation, the it “largely operates as a conventional opposition party whose resistance to government does not include an anti-system narrative” (Faiz 2022a, 1).\nReferences\nAbid, Muhammad. 2017. “Muttahida Qaumi Movement: Mode of Politics and Political Attitudes.” Pakistan Perspectives 22 (2).\nAhmar, Moonis. 1996. “Ethnicity and State Power in Pakistan: The Karachi Crisis.” Asian Survey 36 (10): 1031–48.\nAyoob, Mohammed. 1985. “Dateline Pakistan: A Passage to Anarchy?” Foreign Policy, no. 59: 154–73.\nBaloch, Bilal. 2012. “The Role of Leadership and Rhetoric in Identity Politics: Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM), a Case Study.” Al Nakhlah, 1–13.\nCheema, Azeema, Johann Chacko, and Shirin Gul. 2019. “Mobilising Mass Anxieties: Fake News and the Amplification of Socio-Political Conflict in Pakistan.” Fake News 17.\nDawn. 2018. “Muttahida Qaumi Movement - Pakistan,” July 18, 2018. https://www.dawn.com/news/1404613.\nEvans, Alexander. 2012. “Continuity and Change in Pakistani Politics1.” Contemporary South Asia 20 (2): 213–24.\nFaiz, Asma. 2022a. “The Peculiar Case of the Pakistan Peoples Party as an Opposition Party.”\n———. 2022b. “We Are on the Same Page: The Curious Case of Imran Khan’s Populism in Pakistan.” In Contemporary Populists in Power, edited by Alain Dieckhoff, Christophe Jaffrelot, and Elise Massicard, 55–74.

    "text": "Vladirim Zhirinovsky / Liberal Democratic Party\nThe Liberal Democratic Party of Vladmir Zhirinovsky has been a feature of Russian politics since the end of the USSR. Having been a critic of the ruling Communist Party in its last decade in power, Zhirinovsky was a candidate in the first democratic elections in 1991, where he was a notably flamboyant “common folk” opposition to the standard boring communist politician (Eatwell, 2002:6). His campaign featured populist measures about fighting crime, cutting the price of vodka, and finding husbands for unmarried women (Kipp, 1994:74; Eatwell, 2002:6). He also developed a radically ethno-nationalist stance (Kipp, 1994:77), advoating re-conquering the former imperial lands of the old Russian Empire (and even more by conquering Iran and Afghanistan) (Koman, 1996) and praises of Hitler (Eatwell, 2002:7), combined with a chauvinistic measure of racism, anti-semitism, anti-Islam and sexism (Alexeev, 2006:211). He measured 3 on the OTH_FOREIGN for his opinions of the West, post-soviet successor states in the CIS, neighbouring Islamic states (Turkey and Iran in particular), and China (Koman, 1996; Alexeev, 2006:212). I’ve seen no evidence that his politics has exhibited any OTH_FINANCIAL elements, and according to Eatwell (2002:7) business elites were a source of support for the LDP in its early years. The LDP’s economic platform has been characterised as a kind of state-capitalism supportive of privatisation (Kipp, 1994:79).\nWhile the party has well-defined ideological foundations, the flamboyant, controversial, and media-savy personality of Zhirinovsky has clearly been paramount in holding the party together (CHARISMA = 3) (Kipp, 1994:86; Eatwell, 2002:7), especially considering that it has rivals on the far right. I’ve labelled his OTH_POLCLASS score as high in initial elections but receding from around the 1995 election, as it seemed that this peaked in the initial post-communist era. Over the years he’s become so stable and unthreatening in the party system that he could hardly the anti-establishment figure that he used to be. Behind the scenes he seems to have worked reasonably closely with both Yeltsin (Eatwell, 2002:9) and Putin (Colton & Hale 2014). Colton and Hale even suggest that Zhirinovski is Putin’s “officially tolerated nationalist”, given that the absorbes some protest votes while remaining cooperative (2014:7). He is somewhat difficult to characterise on LIBDEMNORMS given the fragile state of these norms in Russia. In spite of this, I’ve labelled him 3 throughout his career given his vocal suggestions that his desired reconstituted Russian Empire requires centralised political control with no separation of powers (Kipp, 1994:77)."

    "text": "Alexander Lebed\nAlexander Lebed, a former general who ran for president in 1996 under the Congress of Russian Communities party, is a tricky one to characterise. He ran a generally centre-right campaign with a common-man “outsider” appeal grounded in general sense of Russian nationalism linked to his military service (particularly in Moldova, where he favoured the ethnic Russians in Transnistria in defiance of more moderate orders from Moscow) (Phillips, 1997). However his populist appeal was based on his incorruptable image, rather than that of a controversial firebrand figure like Zhirinovsky (Phillips, 1997; Hale, 2006:75). This was bult in part on his open criticism of the corruption of superiors (“thieves”) in the military and defence bureaucracy (Simonsen, 1995:538). He also accused the political class of selling out to the west – unlike former corrupt statesmen who looted from imperial territories and brought it back to Russia, “our contempporarys in the other hand do their robberies at home and bring the loot abroad. Here heads have to roll, mercilessly” (Simonsen, 1995:543). While this is clearly evidence of OTH_POLCLASS rhetoric, this seems not to have escalated beyond a 2 on our scale. His political platform was based on a strong nationalist streak critical of the West’s treatment of post-soviet Russia (Simonsen, 1995:540), although his opposition to OTH_FOREIGN did not reach the scale of Zhirinovski or Putin (2).\nWhile Lebed seems like a supporter of democratic institutions, his controversial praise for the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet in Chile, and the fact that he defended the comment by praising Rissian dictatorships from Peter the Great to Stalin, (Simonsen, 1995:542) suggest that he was a mild threat to LIBDEMNORMS (2). His candidacy was clearly centred no his personal saviour image (CHARISMA=3), and I have not seen evidence of any significant OTH_IMMIGRANTS or OTH_ETHNIC discourse. I have not seen evidence for any OTH_FINANCIAL populist politics, although further research should confirm this. After serving in Yeltsin’s cabinet after the 1996 election (from which he was fired), he served as governor of Krasnoyarsk Krai, and elected not to run for president against Putin in 2000 despite expectations that he would. He died in a plane crash in 2002"

    "text": "Vladimir Putin / Unity / United Russia\nVladimir Putin’s form of populism (and that of his Unity and United Russia party) is tricky to explain. By some accounts he did not run as a populist in his initial election in 2000, but introduced populist rhetoric gradually in the mid-2000s (following the ‘colour’ revolutions in the CIS and the Iraq War) and especially after the 2011-12 election cycle (when Putin’s economic narrative was hit by the 2008 econoomic crisis) (Robinson 2017; Robinson and Milne 2017). Around the time of his first re-election in 2004, he started to develop a “sovereign democracy” rhetoric that defined Russian nationalism as distinct from the western world, and Putin as the undisputed savoir preventing the return of Yeltsen-era instability, incompetance and weakness (Casula 2013; Robinson and Milne 2017:). When Putin returned to the presidency in after a one-term hiatus 2012, this rhetoric of anti-western nationalism in was ramped up and combined with a ‘cultural turn’ (anti-LGBT laws, strengthened ties to the Orthodox Church, etc.) (Robinson 2017) that have created what many consider to be an official ‘strongman’ populism today.\nThere is a common argument that Putin’s portrayal of the political elite and the state bureaucracy constitutes what we would register as OTH_POLCLASS populism. There is some evidence of this kind of populism: Unity, for example, denied that it was even a party, saying instead that it was merely an association of people fed up with seeing others decide their fate (Eatwell, 2002:10). Likewise, UR has stated that it represents merely “common sense” and that it “transcends ideological myths” associated with other politicians and corrupt lethargy of bureaucrats (Casula 2013:5, 7). These are all examples of distancing the part and its leaders from other politicians. On the other hand, some claim that Putin’s origins as an insider run contrary to his portrayal as a true populist. Lassila (2018) goes as far as arguing that Russia’s historical experience has produced a unique distrust in “the people” as a political agent, and suggests instead that Putin be considered a non-populist autocrat. At a minimum, it is not clear that Putin has engaged in any explicit OTH_POLCLASS rhetoric, and hence for now this is left at 1 throughout his tenure. This should be reviewed.\nPutin has never envoked any OTH_FINANCIAL, OTH_IMMIGRANT, OTH_ETHNIC or OTH_MILITARY populist rhetoric to registers on our variables. His most important “other” is clearly OTH_FOREIGN, which I have labelled as 1 initially, escalating to 2 by the 2003-4 election period, and reaching 3 by the 2011-12 election period. Putin was obviously an INSIDER from the beginning, just as Unity was created as a party of power. LIBDEMNORMS are somewhat tricky given that these were never particularlystrnog t begin with in Russia. However it seems fitting to label Putin/UR 2 from his beginnings and escalate this to 3 by the 2011-12 period given its increasingly authoritarian and autocratic nature. The most difficult of all the variables here is CHARISMA. Unity was clearly built around the ambitions of Putin and were dependent on his personality, and many have argued that Putin has acted as the “empty signifier” of his and his party’s brand of populism (Casula 2013:7). However it is debatable that Putin’s populism was a personality-dependent form during his rise in 2000. An argument could be made that Putin was simply popular based on his political skills and image as a relatively competent manager. I’ve labelled the party 3 from its inception, but this should be reviewed."

Its original message was left wing and nationalist (OTH_FINANCIAL=3), campaigning to reverse privatisations from the 1990s and nationalise other assets. However it became better known for its radical anti-immigrant advertising that included suggestions that ethnic Russians needed to clean “garbage” from their cities (Varga, 2008:570) (OTH_IMMIGRANT=3, OTH_ETHNIC=3). For this reason it has been characterised mainly as a far right party even though it had solid left credentials. This ideological position should be investigated further. Authorities took the unprecedented step of banning the party for this rhetoric in 2005. Little is written about the group in English, so these codings need to be reviewed. The party merged withseveral others to create the “Just Russia” Party, another more consistently left-wing party with ties to the Kremlin.

    "text": "Donald Trump\nCelebrity businessman and real estate scion Donald Trump ran a populist campaign for the presidency in 2016, after first successfully seeking the Republican party’s nomination. His campaign centred on a brash hostility to the political class, an abrasive attitude to his opponents, an air of national economic and cultural crisis, and a loose ideological grounding of right-wing nativism and nationalism. Throughout the campaign Trump built off his well-established brand to court media attention through controversial statements (Jacobson, 2017:15), and his clinching of the nomination and presidency – although neither included majorities of the vote – surprised most observers. While Trump can be placed in a long tradition of American populism (see: Savage, 2019), he is generally considered to be a departure from the norms of presidential campaigning in recent generations (Appel, 2018:157). As with some others in the literature (Fenger, 2018:193; Schneiker, 2020:2) we’ve elected not to categorise the whole Republican party as populist in the same ways as Trump was.\nTrump distinguished himself with an uncompromisingly ad hominin rhetoric against his political opponents (Mendes, 2016:65; Appel, 2018; Nai & Maier, 2018:82) whom he collectivised as a broader “elite” political “establishment” (Oliver and Rahn, 2016:193; Jensen & Bang, 2017:355). Throughout the 2016 campaign he used the slogan “drain the swamp” to suggest that the corruption of Washington D.C. had become entrenched and systemic (Rudolph, 2019:1), suggested that the “system is rigged against our citizens” in favour of the powerful (Jamieson & Taussig, 2017:624), and claimed in typically populist terms that on “every major issue affecting this country, the people are rights and the governing elite are wrong” (Oliver and Rahn, 2016:189). He pledged to be the “voice” of the “American people” against this establishment (Ostiguy & Roberts, 2016:43). In the 2016 election, this antipathy to the governing elite was trained most directly on opponent Hilary Clinton (whom he said should be put in prison for corruption, Biegon, 2019:527), but also against high profile members of his own party, the media and the state, suggesting a holistically anti-political class discourse (OTH_POLCLASS = 3).\nAntipathy toward immigration on cultural, economic and security grounds formed a key component of the Trump campaign (Mendes, 2016:65), and was manifested in his policy to build a wall along the Mexican border and force Mexico to pay for it. This anti-immigrant sentiment applied to asylum seekers from Syria, whom he promised to deport if he won (Mendes, 2016:65). He also repeatedly linked the control of immigration with terrorism (Hall, 2020:5) (OTH_IMMIGRANTS = 3). This anti-immigrant stance correlated with an ethnocentric rhetoric that demonised Muslims, Mexicans (seemingly by extension, Latinxs), and other minorities (Jacobson, 2017:20; Biegon, 2019:523; Savage, 2019:409). A few notable examples of this discourse were: his claim that the immigrants being “sent” by Mexico were “bringing crime, they’re rapists” at his campaign commencement speech (Edwards, 2018:185); proposing a ban on Muslims from entering the country; questioning the qualification of an American-born judge to preside over his affairs on the basis that “he’s a Mexican”; and asserting without evidence the conspiracy theory that Muslim’s cheered when the World Trade Centre was attacked on September 11, 2001 (see: Jamieson & Taussig, 2017; Hall, 2020; Savage, 2019:402). Of relevance here is his intense media campaign years earlier alleging that incumbent President Barack Obama (2009-17) was born in Kenya and ineligible for the presidency – something many scholars consider a racist dog whistle given that Obama is African American (Kellner, 2017:81). More broadly, many scholars have also considered Trump campaign rhetoric to tap into deeper anxieties among white voters (Bobo, 2017; Ostiguy & Roberts, 2016:44). It is debatable whether all of this should earn Trump a 2 or 3 on our OTH_ETHNIC coding, given that his ethnocentrism was still somewhat implicit and more opaque than more outright ethnic majoritarian populist candidates in Europe and elsewhere. While this could be further discussed, we’ve coded Trump 2 on this scale.\nTrump is often considered to have upended the Republican party’s prior association with economic liberalism and free trade orthodoxy (Ostiguy & Roberts, 2016:41), and taken a sharper stance against major American businesses that sent jobs offshore (Edwards, 2018:182; Schneiker, 2020:3-4). While this is some truth to this, it would be a stretch to register this rhetoric on the OTH_FINANCIAL variable as he did not really portray the country’s wealthy and business class as the core of the problem. Claiming to be a billionaire himself, he often praised loyal businesses and repeated neoliberal mantras about the intrusiveness of government regulations. In his acceptance speech for the Republican nomination for example he pledged to make America “rich again using the greatest business people in the world” (cited in Ostiguy & Roberts, 2016:43). Hence while high profile businesses and wealthy figures may have occasionally been on Trump’s 2016 enemies list, the wealthy did not constitute a core “other” to the people in his populist discourse. This remained the case during the first term of the Trump presidency, when feuds with the likes of Jeff Bezos or the Koch brothers (Boucher and Thies, 2019:714) (OTH_FINANCIAL=1). In office, Trump has pursued more neoliberal economic policies than his campaign suggested.\nForeign states played an important role in the Trump campaign’s conceptualisation of the American People’s opponents. Trump routinely claimed that other countries were ripping America off and free-riding on its generosity (Ostiguy & Roberts, 2016:44). This extended from military alliances like NATO to trade imbalances with Mexico and China and asylum seeker resettlement arrangements. At times this formed a general anti-globalization agenda that pushed back not only on free trade, but on global institutions and rules (Biegon, 2019:529; Edwards, 2018). While these foreign and “global” powers were clearly relevant “others” to Trump’s American people, this doesn’t quite extend to the point of local leaders acting on their behalf, and therefore OTH_FOREIGN is coded 2. The military did not feature as an “other” in Trump’s rhetoric (OTH_MILITARY = 1).\nWhile the 2016 campaign pushed back on some economic policies of the American right (see above), Trump’s cultural nativism, nationalism and underlying neo-liberalism clearly make his campaign right wing (LRPOSITION = R). Trump’s brash persona has undoubtedly been central to his campaign’s appeal (Schneiker, 2020). A key component of this image has been Trump’s willingness to provide an official interpretation of seemingly every news story and event, often on direct channels like Twitter and call-ins to news programs, creating a personalised and centralised source of political information to his supporters. This occasionally reached comical level when he claimed, for example, that he knew more about ISIS than “the generals” (Hall, 2020:6). By claiming of America’s crisis that “I alone can fix it” his campaign built a saviour complex around his personality and leadership (Lieberman et al, 2019:2). However as Trump was the nominee of the well-established Republican Party, he should be coded 2 by the definition of our CHARISMA variable. While Trump had occasionally donated to politicians of both parties, he had never served in government in any capacity, and is therefore coded 1 for INSIDER.\nThe Trump campaign and presidency have pushed significantly against liberal democratic norms in several ways (see Lieberman et al, 2019). As a candidate he questioned the integrity of democratic and judicial institutions, official government statistics on matters areas like labour and immigration, and the impartiality of federal law enforcement organisations (Jamieson & Taussig, 2017:620, 627). At several of his campaign rallies he encouraged supporters to assault protesters (Mendes, 2016:66; Ostiguy & Roberts, 2016:44), and in the words of Mendes (2016:66) “[h]e seems perfectly willing to countenance illegal acts and abandon due process to combat the threats he invokes.” He has been extremely hostile to media criticism, and declared that the media was the “enemy of the American people” (Jamieson & Taussig, 2017:638). As with OTH_ETHNIC, the LDNORMS scale is difficult with Trump, because there’s a good case for him to be coded either 2 or 3. While this could be further debated, we’ve concluded that the above actions shouldn’t quite reach the point of “threatening the democratic order”, and hence he is coded 2."

    "text": "Not Included\nBillionaire Ross Perot’s presidential candidacy in 1992 and 1993 is often considered to be populist, which seems to be for three reasons. First his rhetoric was explicitly pro-“people” in somewhat populist terms. In advertisements, interviews and debates, Perot routinely claimed that ordinary people had been left out of politics, and contrasted this problem with his own campaign which was driven more by voluntary engagement rather than the backing of major parties. Take for example his call to “go back to what this country is supposed to be about. The voters own this country” (Prendergast, 2008:29). Second, Perot styled himself as a true outsider to American political incumbents of both parties, and claimed that his mission as “cleaning out the political barn” (Prinz, 1994; Broussard, 1995:62). This was coupled with an anti-politics (Brown, 1997) characterisation Washington as “the system” without significant differences between the major parties (Schulte-Sasse, 1993), and hence one with a political class in control. Third, his appeal (although his campaign was based on highly programmatic policy proposals about the budget and inequality) was highly charisma based, and his plain -spoken and folksy persona was billed as an antidote to a general crisis facing the county’s economic management (Owen & Dennis, 1996:384; Tonn & Endress, 2001:281).\nWhile there is a claim that this constitutes a kind of populism, we find that his characterisation of the incumbent political order was not actually populist by our definition, and fits more within the norms of “outsider” campaigning by major party candidates in American politics, albeit in a more concentrated form. Perot claimed that he was fighting the “system” but said the failings of this systems to be flawed ideas, estrangement from the real issues of everyday people, and dominated by “paid professionals” (Prendergast, 2008:27). Lacking in this characterisation of the incumbent order was any accusatory anti-elitism that suggested the elite was of any kind of ill-character or corruption, of that the problems of ordinary people were benefiting those incumbents. In fact, Perot claimed that there was too much negativity in political campaigning (Prendergast, 2008:27), and suggested that many of his antagonists in the system were “fine people” (Schulte-Sasse, 1993:95).\nReferences\nEdward C.

Since no candidate won more than 51% of the vote, Walter Guevara, the president of the Senate, was invested president. In November of that same year, General Natusch staged another coup d´état but a popular insurrection made it fail two weeks later. Lidia Gueiler, president of the Congress, was elected president and new elections were held in June 1980. Hernán Siles Zuazo was the most voted candidate but he could not be elected president because a third coup d’état, perpetrated by General García Meza, took place. The new military dictatorship continued until 1982, when massive strikes triggered its fall. The elections of 1980 were considered legitimate and Siles Zuazo was elected president in 1982.\nUntil the victory of Evo Morales in 2006, three parties dominated Bolivian politics: the Revolutionary Nationalist Movement, Nationalist Democratic Action and Revolutionary Left Movement. Since the Bolivian system makes it difficult for any party to obtain a majority, governments have traditionally been decided through various agreements between these three parties. The lack of perception of a clear alternative within these political options aided in the development of populist parties in Bolivia in the 90’s and 2000’s. Barr (2017: 83), Van Cott (2007), Madrid (2012) and Mayorga (2003) agree upon identifying CONDEPA, UCS and MAS as the main populist parties in Bolivia since the reinstatement of democracy."

    "text": "CONDEPA\nThe history of CONDEPA is dependent on the evolution of its leader, Carlos Palenque. Palenque started his career as a musician of a group that introduced popular indigenous rhythms in their songs and later became a very successful TV host. One of his most famous programs consisted in hearing the complaints and everyday stories of mainly indigenous peoples, an activity he combined with social and philanthropic actions. He always claimed his was the “radio of the people” (Alenda Mary, 2002: 89) and gained fame as the “compadre” a term which refers to a father figure for those that needed it the most (Mayorga, 2003: 106). His involvement in politics started when the government decided to close all of Palenque’s media outlets because of an interview in which the president was accused of being related to drug trafficking. A massive popular mobilization protested the closure of the radios and, in response, Palenque, who had very little previous experience in politics, created CONDEPA or Conscience of Fatherland (1 in Insider Populism).\nCONDEPA was largely based on the messianic charisma of Palenque, who used to dress and talk in popular ways in order to differentiate himself from other politicians (3 in Charisma). Van Cott (2007: 85) identifies CONDEPA with the left and its rhetoric aimed at establishing an emotional connection with the electorate (Mayorga, 2003: 109). He ran a platform based on the protection of the marginal sectors of society by the state and the defense of national resources (Plano Medio, 2011). Madrid explains the political platform of the party in the following way:\n\nCONDEPA, Perú Posible, and the PNP have employed populist appeals to an even greater extent than ethnic appeals. They have run campaigns centered on the personal characteristics of their leaders, rather than on the parties or their programs. They have employed anti-establishment messages, presenting their leaders as political outsiders and as honest and grassroots alternatives to the corrupt traditional politicians. And they have focused their appeals primarily on the lower classes. They have forged alliances with numerous working-class groups from peasant associations to unions, informal sector organizations, and neighborhood groups. The leaders of these parties have adopted a popular, at times folksy, style of campaigning, and much of their discourse has centered on meeting the needs of disadvantaged and neglected sectors of the population. Some of the mestizo-led parties, such as CONDEPA and the PNP, have also made nationalist and state interventionist appeals, denouncing neo-liberal policies and U.S. intervention. (Madrid, 2012: 29)\n\nIn fact, Palenque opposed the liberalizing measures that the government was implementing because he defended an “endogenous model” which would make Bolivia self-sufficient with its own resources (Plano Medio, 2011). I have, thus, coded CONDEPA as 3 in Political Class, Financial Class and Foreign Interest and Left-wing as its ideology.\nThe indigenous element is fundamental to CONDEPA’s platform. Himself a mestizo (Madrid, 2012: 48), Palenque appealed to the Aymara community and often invoked Aymara sayings and traditions (Alenda Mary, 2002). His support base was basically composed of indigenous people that lived around La Paz (Madrid, 2012: 29). Moreover, his party was the first in electing a “chola” (indigenous woman) to the Bolivian Parliament. Since I have not found any anti-immigrant rhetoric, I have coded 1 for Ethnic Others and Immigration.\nFollowing Panebianco, Mayorga (2003: 111) describes CONDEPA as a ‘charismatic party’ whose functioning was based on loyalty to the leader and the subordination of formal rules to the personal and familial links to Palenque (Mayorga, 2003: 113). Since the figure of the leader is stressed in all the texts that addressed CONDEPA, I have coded 3 for Charisma.\nI have neither found claims against the military nor any violation of established LD norms. In fact, despite their rhetoric, Mayorga (2003: 115) claims that “their emergence did not call into question the democratic regime because they soon participated in the logic of post-electoral deals that characterized the access to national and municipal governments”. Thus, they reached agreements with some of the so-called “neoliberal parties” and did not threaten the usual way of forming governments in Bolivia (1 in Military and LD Norms).\nCONDEPA’s biggest challenge was faced in 1997 when, just a couple of months before the elections, Carlos Palenque suddenly died. He was substituted by Remedios Loza, the first ‘chola’ to enter the Bolivian parliament. Loza had been with Palenque since his time in the radio and she was known as the “comadre”, the female equivalent to the “compadre”. Loza exhibited a clear continuist line with the politics and proposals of Palenque (Alenda Mary, 116). “The credibility of the succession oath that Remedios took in front of the compadre’s tomb was interpreted as loyalty to her leader, a leader close to which she has ‘experienced the problems of the people’ as her loyal ‘disciple’” (Alenda Mary, 2002: 118-119). Thus, considering that Palenque led most of the campaign until the very end, that Remedios was also a charismatic character and that she displayed clear continuities with her predecessor, I have not changed the coding from the 1993 elections to the 1997 elections."

    "text": "UCS\nSolidarity Civic Unity (or UCS) is usually compared to the case of CONDEPA because both were populist parties that enjoyed relative success in Bolivia in the 90’s and that suffered the loss of their charismatic founders. Similarly, to Palenque, Max Fernández, founder of UCS, became famous in his field before he entered politics without previous experience (1 Insider Populism). Fernández was CEO of the largest beer company in Bolivia and he was known for his philanthropic donations to the poor.\nBarr (2017: 90) clearly identifies the party as populist due to its use of “antiestablishment rhetoric and plebiscitarian linkages” and appeals “to informal sector workers and marginalized groups, including indigenous populations”. The party defended a greater solidarity among the population (one of its mottos was “The poor less poor and the rich more solidary” (Alenda Mary, 2002: 97)) and bashed traditional politicians (Mayorga, 2003: 109). However, the UCS lacked a programmatic proposal and an ideological profile (Mayorga, 2003: 115). Mayorga (2003) sums up the party’s ideology with the term “asistencialismo”. Asistencialismo implies that the leader solves problems through the donation of money to a specific marginal group without an ideological basis and without addressing structural problems. As a wealthy man, Fernández was able to perform many acts of philanthropy through which he formed his electoral basis (Mayorga, 2003: 99) which Alenda Mary (2002: 86) has described as “pure clientelism”.\nMoreover, he cultivated an image of a mestizo self-made man that came from below and was able to achieve success as a businessman (Mayorga, 2003: 106-107). Barr (2017: 13) considers the UCS as “little more than a personalistic vehicle” and Alenda Mary (2002: 98) says that their “program is the leader”. As opposed to the large social movement led by Palenque, Max Fernández’s base was created thanks to personalistic ties with the leader’s philanthropic actions (Mayorga, 2003).\nFernández included Aymara candidates in his party (Barr, 2017: 90) and he also “spoke Quechua on the campaign trail and was often referred to as a”cholo” entrepreneur, although he generally eschewed identity politics.” (Madrid, 2012: 47). This allowed him to win a “sizable number of indigenous votes” (Madrid, 2012: 47) (1 in Ethnic Others and Immigration).\nIt is difficult to code UCS in the remaining categories. I believe the less problematic coding is to consider UCS as a Center party, that is populist in relation to anti-politician rhetoric (3 Political class) but whose criticisms of foreign powers and economic elite are not as stark as those of CONDEPA (2 in Foreign Interests and Financial elite). The party is extremely dependent on its leader (3 in Charisma) who comes from the business world without any previous political experience (1 in Insider Populism).\nI have not found any indication of a violation of LD norms. As Mayorga pointed out in relation to both UCS and CONDEPA: “their emergence did not call into question the democratic regime because they soon participated in the logic of post-electoral deals that characterized the access to national and municipal governments” (Mayorga, 2003: 115).\nIn a similar fashion to CONDEPA, Max Fernández died suddenly in 1995 and the party had to adapt to the new situation. The leadership role landed in Jhonny Fernández, Max’s son (Alenda Mary, 2002: 111). His legitimacy derived from him being the son of the party founder and from becoming mayor of Santa Cruz soon after his father’s death (Alenda Mary, 2002: 111-112). He continued with his father’s policies and rhetoric and was a candidate in the 2002 presidential election. However, due to lack of age, he was not able to run in the 1997 election, and the party chose Ivo Kulijs, another businessman, to take his place. Barr (2017: 83) considers the three leaders of UCS as populist, however, Jhonny Fernández and Ivo Kulijs did not have the charisma of Max Fernández and they basically attracted voters exploiting the memory of the founder. Thus, I have coded 1 in Charisma for both Jhonny Fernández and Ivo Kulijs. During their leadership UCS formed part of Banzer’s Right-wing government support coalition, which speaks to their ideological flexibility."

    "text": "MAS\nMovement for Socialism was a dying fascist party when Evo Morales’ political platform used it as a mere legal cover to run for elections in the 1999 municipal elections (Monasterios et al., 2007: 79). Morales completely changed the character and ideology of the party in order to transform it into an indigenous and populist party.\nEvo Morales, of Aymara origin, started working in agriculture at an early age and received little formal education. He later rose as a union leader of coca plantations in the region of Cochabamba (Madrid, 2012: 63). During the 90’s, several of the peasant unions, composed overwhelmingly of indigenous people, created indigenous parties to run for election. Although “in the mid-1990s he was still largely unknown outside of Cochabamba”, Evo Morales ran for congress in 1997 as part of one of these parties winning “seventy percent of the vote, more than any other congressional candidate in the country” (Madrid, 2012: 63). Due to conflicts with the leaders of the party, Morales decided to abandon it and create his own. Since his party could not register on time for the 1999 municipal elections, he allied with MAS as the official running party. Unexpectedly, Morales surged in the polls in the last weeks of the 2002 electoral campaign and came in second (Madrid, 2012: 49). He later won an absolute majority in 2005 and became president. I have coded him as 1 in Insider Populism in the 2002 and 2005 election and as 3 in the following elections.\nWhat distinguishes MAS from other typical populist movements is the presence of “strong grassroots bases that help shape the parties’ platforms and policies.” (Madrid, 2012: 27). MAS started as an indigenous party and has always remained committed to that origin. As Madrid (2012: 53) puts it\n\nThe MAS has succeeded in part because it has appealed to Bolivia’s indigenous population as indigenous people. It has used a variety of methods to woo indigenous voters. First, the MAS has established close ties with a vast number of indigenous organizations in the country. Second, the MAS has run numerous indigenous candidates, including for high-profile positions. Third, the MAS has made a variety of symbolic appeals to Bolivia’s indigenous population. Fourth and finally, the MAS has aggressively promoted traditional indigenous demands. (Madrid, 2012: 53).\n\nFurthermore, MAS “called for the recognition of indigenous forms of medicine and justice and the establishment of programs of intercultural and bilingual education that would incorporate indigenous traditions and knowledge” (Madrid, 2012: 56) and was also committed to eliminate racial discrimination through new labor laws (Movimiento al Socialismo 2002, 25). Lastly, the party’s candidates defended not just pro-indigenous policies but also “often dressed in indigenous clothing, participated in indigenous rituals, invoked indigenous sayings, and made speeches in indigenous languages” (Madrid, 2012: 55). 1 in Ethnic others and Immigration.\nHowever, MAS is not simply an indigenous party, what characterizes Morales’ political platform is the combination of ethnic and populist elements. Madrid argues that MAS\n\nruns personalistic electoral campaigns that have revolved around the charismatic personality of its presidential candidate […], has employed extensive anti-establishment rhetoric, aggressively criticizing the traditional parties and politicians […] [and] has employed nationalist and state interventionist appeals. It has staunchly opposed market-oriented policies and U.S. intervention in their countries, and it has vowed to assert greater control over their countries’ natural resources. (Madrid, 2012: 27).\n\nMorales strongly criticized the elite, which he termed “neoliberal parties,” “political mafia,” “oligarchy,” and “mank’a- gastos”—those who eat without working (Assies and Salman, 2005: 271). He clearly articulated the Manichean opposition between people and elite when he said that “We all know that there are two Bolivias. One Bolivia of ‘charlatans’ who always make promises and sign agreements that they never fulfill; and the other Bolivia which is always tricked, subjugated, humiliated, and exploited” (Morales, cited in Postero, 2004: 190). Morales has described inequality as one of the central reasons for the formation of the party, declaring that: “We have created our own political force because wealth and land are being concentrated in the hands of a few, and the majority of the people live in poverty” (Zimmerman, 2002: 8).\nAs Barr argues “he directed his permanent provocation toward a ‘second independence’ and the ‘re-founding of the country.’ Morales thus framed a reformist agenda in very bold terms. For instance, he promised to ‘bury neoliberalism,’ promote the production of legal coca, nationalize hydrocarbons, and rewrite the constitution.” (Barr, 2017: 106). Morales also often attacked foreign intervention. In 2002, MAS’ governing program said:\n\nThe neoliberal parties such as the MNR, ADN, MIR, MBL, UCS, NFR, CONDEPA and other small groupings of their corrupt circle, are characterized by the submission and betrayal of the country, by the handing over of the national patrimony almost without charge to the voraciousness of international capital and its directors, who impose conditions of poverty on the legitimate owners of natural resources. (Movimiento al Socialismo, 2002: 9).\n\nTherefore, Morales’ rhetoric represents an ideal-typical case of Left-wing populist rhetoric and I have coded his ideology as Far-Left, and 3 in Political class, Economic class and Foreign Interests.\nIt is the combination of the populist and ethnic elements that made the party adopt an inclusivist strategy and rhetoric. “Beginning in 2002 the MAS recruited numerous white and mestizo candidates, formed alliances throughout the country with non-indigenous as well as indigenous organizations, and developed a more inclusive and populist discourse” (Madrid, 2012: 28). Central to these alliances was the appointment of Álvaro García Linera, a well-known leftist academic and a scholar in populism to become the vice-presidential candidate in 2005 (Harnecker et al., 2008: 102).\nMorales has concentrated the party power around his figure, particularly in regard to the party’s extension to non-indigenous regions. Barr (2017: 103) explains that Morales’s approach “was first to create urban-based arms of MAS, which were under his personal control. However, these new urban structures lacked the participatory mechanisms of the earlier rural ones”. “Like other populist leaders, Evo has mostly declined to build institutional structures that might constrain him or develop leaders who might challenge him, preferring instead to concentrate power in his person.” (Madrid, 2012: 63). However, Morales’ personalism is not limited to the party’s structure but the party in itself is dependent on his charisma. Some observers speak about ‘Evismo’ a phenomenon similar to the personality cults surrounding other populist leaders like Juan Perón (Benavente 2008, 61). Therefore, although other indigenous parties would have existed without Morales, a party that combined populist and ethnic claims in such as successful manner would have been impossible without the figure of its leader (3 in Charisma).\nThe army did not constitute a target of Morales’ anti-elite rhetoric and when he took office, he replaced the military leadership with his supporters as a means to assure himself control of the army (El País, 2007).\nIn relation to liberal-democratic norms, Mudde and Rovira-Kaltwasser (2013) point to the political, social and symbolic inclusion of excluded sectors of Bolivia that Morales has expressed during his campaigns and achieved during his presidency. However, they also note that\n\nAlthough the political initiatives promoted by Chávez and Morales have triggered more political participation, they have also undermined the rules of public contestation... [Morales] has relied on ‘the people’ as the constituent power in order to undertake constitutional reforms that do not necessarily protect the checks and balances that are inherent to liberal democracy (Cameron and Sharpe, 2010). (Mudde and Rovira-Kaltwasser, 2013: 162)\n\nMorales has concentrated great power in his person, and some have argued that “Evo is very much of a caudillo [strongman], very personalistic. He does not allow any dissidence. He turns his back on or expels any legislator who competes with him” (Madrid, 2012: 63). The supreme courts are chosen in a highly politicized manner and reports on attacks on the press are abundant (Freedom House, 2018).\nMorales has eschewed Bolivian political institutions towards his policies and aims. Morales called for a constitutional assembly shortly after winning his first elections. He obtained a majority of seats in the new assembly and rewrote the Constitution. This was a highly contentious issue and the political environment became polarized. “In an effort to break the growing political impasse, in 2008 the government called for a referendum on whether to recall President Morales and the departmental governors (prefects). Once again, the MAS triumphed” (Madrid, 2012: 51). Thus, although he has made significant changes to prior democratic rules in the country, he has done so with wide popular support.\nIn 2016, however, Morales lost a referendum on whether he could be reelected for a fourth term even though it being prohibited by the Constitution. Despite the referendums’ result and the Constitutional text, MAS pressured the judges into declaring that article unconstitutional and have allowed Morales to run for reelection (BBC, 2017). This represents the clearest violation of LD norms committed by Morales’ administration.\nGiven Morales’ initial inclusivist discourse in support of marginalized groups in Bolivia, I have coded him as 1 in violation of LD norms in the 2002 and 2005 elections. However, once in office, his actions against democratic check and balances, attacks on the press and violation of the Constitution point to a coding closer to a 3.\nReferences\nAlenda Mary, S.

    "text": "As an entrenched dominant party with multiple internal political traditions, the African National Congress (ANC) is difficult to categorically depict as holistically populist at any point. The period of Jacob Zuma’s leadership, however, is generally seen by the literature to be a “ANC’s populist turn” (Vincent 2011, 8), that fundamentally shifted the party’s political narrative. Zuma was previously the deputy president before being sacked by President Thabo Mbeki in 2005 on corruption grounds. From that point he became the figurehead of an anti-Mbeki faction of the ANC and its allies (Gumede 2008, 264), resulting in his successful challenge for the party leadership at Polokwane in 2007. He went on to lead the party to victory in elections in 2009 and 2014, before being forced to resign in 2018 due to a number of high-profile scandals. While Zuma’s own rhetoric, behaviour, and charisma was important in signifying the ANC’s populist turn (see below) the embrace of populism under his leadership was far deeper than him, including the rise to prominence of other figures representing a broader “politics of grievance and resentment” that came together around is presidential candidacy (Hart 2007, 86; see also Ndlovu-Gatsheni 2008; Tshabangu 2022, 46; Cooper 2015, 156; Bassett and Clarke 2008, 797). In Ndlovu-Gatsheni’s words, a nativist and populist politics “crystalis[ed] around” Zuma at the time of the Mbeki transition (Ndlovu-Gatsheni 2008, 53). Hence, while Zuma’s own populist statements against the elite are relatively thin, such attacks from key allies within the party achieved enough salience to compensate for this in the party’s new discourse. The most important of these allies was Julias Malema, the leader of the ANC Youth League (ANCYL), who has been called Zuma’s “attack dog” (Glaser 2011, 89) and the “oft-quoted battering ram of the ANC’s 2009 electoral campaign” (Vincent 2011, 4).\nClassing Zuma and the ANC as populist for the 2014 election is somewhat more difficult than in 2009. According to some sources the president’s persona and rhetoric after the election changed quickly, (“he can call the mobs off… he has no further need for their service,” (Glaser 2009, 11), and in government he seemed to abandon any tactic of visibly fighting the elite – on the contrary making alliances with key business figures and continuing Mbeki-era policies (Glaser 2011, 68). Most significantly, in 2010 he moved against Malema and other “left populists” in his political faction who dramatically turned their fire on him (Cooper 2015, 156; Glaser 2011, 89). This “served to dampen the spirit of rebellion” that had previously characterised Zuma’s faction (Cooper 2015, 162). However, according to other sources, he did appear to rely on populist tropes in his second campaign (Melber 2014, 645), and deep into his late presidency (Melber 2018, 683; Plaut 2014, 637; cf. Horwitz 2016). Because of this, we’ve kept the ANC in the dataset for the 2014 elections, though this should be reviewed.\nAt the time of his ascendancy, Zuma’s appeal was considered by most observers to have been based in his “anti-elitist” crudentials (Nyandera and Agwanda 2019, 82; Resnick 2010, 21; Vincent 2011, 4). The context for this was the aloof and intellectual image of Mbeki, which seemed to many of Zuma’s supporters to personify the betrayal of ordinary peasants and workers by the ANC (Ndlovu-Gatsheni 2008, 77). Zuma, by contrast, played up his credentials as a non-educated foot soldier in the ANC’s struggle, remote from the self-serving elites who had taken over the party (Hart 2007, 98; Tshabangu 2022, 46). His being sacked by Mbeki and subject to numerous criminal and corruption cases allowed him to embody a sense of victimhood at the hands of that elite (Southall 2009, 319). In Glaser’s words: Zuma’s coalition was mobilised\n\nagainst a range of ‘insider’ elites, first and foremost the leadership cadres and businessmen around Thabo Mbeki but encompassing, if often only subliminally, liberal judges and journalists, intellectuals, gender activists and urban sophisticates. Against these forces, the ‘Zunami’ represented an anti-establishment revolt (Glaser 2009, 9; see also Makulilo 2013, 196–97).\n\nIn doing so Zuma and the ANC consistently portrayed their political rivals as nefarious conspirators against the him and average people, calling them “witches” (Melber 2018, 683), “clever Blacks” (Shain 2017, 6), and \"bright people” (media, opposition politicians) who think they know better (Melber 2014, 645). The sense of antagonism against this elite in Zuma’s discourse is tied up in his “trademark” song, Umshini Wami (“My Machine Gun”), sung so frequently by him that it became “part of [his] skin” (Gunner 2009, 27). The song had very few lyrics, but with its call-to-arms-message “drew boundaries between those perceived as insiders and those seen as outsiders” (Gunner 2009, 32; see also Resnick 2010, 22), and recalled a time when the ANC’s core narrative was not governance but “struggle” (Melber 2018, 683). As mentioned, much of the party’s rhetoric against the political class was outsourced to Malema, who for example, warned the party’s enemies “acting against the youth and the workers you are acting against the people who brought down the apartheid regime . . . they too can bring you down” (Vincent 2011, 4–5)\nThe populist turn under Zuma had elements of race/ethnocentrism and hostility to business and capital – often tied together. Ndlovu-Gatcheni claims that Zuma’s politics had a clearly nativist component, awakening race-populist tropes that had been long-present within the ANC but somewhat subdued in the post-Apartheid era (Ndlovu-Gatsheni 2008). Again, much of the evidence for this comes not from Zuma but from Malema, who, while leading at the ANCYL, made derogatory comments about Whites (Plaut 2010) and Indians (Shain 2017, 8), and accused black critics of the ANC of being “not really black” (Glaser 2011, 74). Relatedly, Zuma engaged in an “unabashed promotion of his Zulu identity” (Resnick 2010, 23; see also Sitas 2008; Glaser 2011, 87). This is partially relevant in populist terms because the ANC had previously been dominated by Xhosa elites (Tshabangu 2022, 46), causing a sense of marginalisation among Zulu (Nyandera and Agwanda 2019, 83). However, this embrace may have been more an attempt to court votes in KwaZuku Natal (Paret 2018, 476) (a province where the ANC had traditionally struggled) (Resnick 2010, 22), rather than to frame national politics and “others” in ethnic terms. Regarding business leaders and the wealthy, numerous sources point out that Zuma positioned himself against “white monopoly capital” (Melber 2018, 683), and that Mbeki’s closeness with business leaders was one of the criticisms against him (Glaser 2009, 9), even though he maintained controversial connections with major financial elites before and after his election to the presidency (Southall 2009, 324). Given the presence of nativist rhetoric in Zuma’s coalition, but the avoidance of full-throated ethnocentrism, we’ve coded the party 2 on OTH_ETHNIC. Likewise, there are clear strands of hostility to financial powerbrokers within this discourse, yet not to the highest extent. Hence we’ve coded OTH_FINANCIAL 2. Despite overseeing a crisis of anti-immigrant violence during his tenure, we’ve seen no sources claim that anti-immigrant discourse was a apart of Zuma or the ANC’s rhetoric (OTH_IMMIGRANT = 1). Similarly absent is hostility to the military (OTH_MILITARY = 1), nor any connection between domestic elites and foreign powers (OTH_FORIEGN = 1).\nZuma’s rise has also been considered by many to have threatened democratic and constitutional norms in South Africa (Southall 2009, 326). The main initial reason for this appears to be his contempt for the judicial process and hostility towards judges (Gumede 2008, 267). As he was charged with both corruption and rape before his ascendency to the ANC leadership, Zuma questioned why judges were “not human beings”. (Vincent 2011, 5). Glaser claims that “[h]is mobs and allies gathered aggressively outside courtrooms, demonized judges as ‘counter-revolutionaries’ and successfully turned the tables on his prosecutorial accusers” (Glaser 2009, 10). Malema, for his part, repeatedly threated violence on behalf of Zuma and other ANC allies (Vincent 2011, 6; Southall 2009, 326). He also put pressure on unfriendly media, threatening them with legal suits and tribunals (Glaser 2009, 10). In government Zuma’s government became “increasingly tyrannical as it set itself up against the constitution and the rule of law,” and increased the state’s control over the media (Chipkin 2018, 101; see also Guha 2013, 7; Gumede 2008, 269). These are significant breaches of liberal democratic norms, but they do not quite rise to the threshold of 3 in our definitions – hence LIBDEMNORMS = 2. Zuma is universally considered to have been a “charismatic” figure (Nyandera and Agwanda 2019, 82; Resnick 2010, 21), who commanded a strong personal following among supporters. To Glaser, this became a “popular cult of Zuma – the belief in Zuma’s almost Jesus-like powers” (Glaser 2009, 11). Given the embeddedness of the ANC at the time of his ascension, we’ve coded the part 2 for CHARISMA under his leadership. Given that he was a former deputy president at the time of his 2009 election, we’ve labelled the ANC 2 on INSIDER in 2009 and 3 in 2014.\nOTH_FOREIGN\nZuma is universally considered to have been a “charismatic” figure (Nyandera and Agwanda 2019, 82; Resnick 2010, 21), who commanded a strong personal following among supporters. To Glaser, this became a “popular cult of Zuma – the belief in Zuma’s almost Jesus-like powers” (Glaser 2009, 11). Given the embeddedness of the ANC at the time of his ascension, we’ve coded the part 2 for CHARISMA under his leadership.\nZuma and his ANC are difficult to categorise ideologically. He has been called a “post-ideological” leader (Glaser 2009, 10), whose political appeal was “not a matter of left-right” (Nyandera and Agwanda 2019, 83). At the time of his ascension, though, he was considered a part of a leftward shift away from the pro-market policies of his predecessors (Chipkin 2018, 104; Gumede 2008, 267), hence the strong support he received from the left factions of the party. Giventhis, and the ANC’s general left leaning profile, we’ve positioned the party as L on LRPOSITION. Zuma was already president by the time of his 2009 election, hence we’ve coded the party 3 on INSIDER in both elections."

    "text": "Economic Freedom Fighters\nThe Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) were formed by former African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) leader Julius Malema in 2013 after his expulsion from the ANC and fall out with president Zuma the previous year. The new party wedded Malema’s faction of the ANCYL with several smaller left-wing parties. In keeping with Malema's well-established confrontational style, the party combined a militant, revolutionary posture with a leftist policy agenda based on nationalisation of assets and land redistribution. The party received 6.35% in its first election in 2014, increasing to 10.8% in 2019.\nThe EFF is thoroughly anti-elitist (Akinola, Oluwaseum, and Tolulope 2015, 110; Nyenhuis and de Jager 2021), training most of its rhetoric against the elite of the ANC (Nyenhuis 2020, 412; Akinola, Oluwaseum, and Tolulope 2015, 109). The ANC elite is considered by the EFF to be a political elite estranged from the black majority, the latter having become a “voting, but powerless majority” (Mbete 2015, 41). A recurring theme of the EFF’s is that the ANC has “sold out” its original black working class constituency (Horwitz 2016, 548; Fölscher, de Jager, and Nyenhuis 2021, 448), for which it had “sheer disregard” (Adams 2018, 115). In Everatt’s words “voting ANC was equated with voting for more of the same – white economic control, white racism, ‘neoliberalism’, black elite sell-outs and little or nothing for ordinary black citizens.” (Everatt 2016, 58). Much of this critique originally centred on Zuma, who was mired in corruption scandals at the time. Malema and the EFF called the president a “thief” in 2013 (Cooper 2015, 153), and pledged to send practically all leading ANC figures to jail for corruption (Nyenhuis 2020, 420). The attacks against the ANC continued after Zuma left in 2018, and in a debate he accused Ramaphosa of becoming “the enemy of the people” driven by personal gain and representing the economic elite (Nyenhuis 2020, 419). Aside from the ANC, Malema has also targeted the other major party, the Democratic Alliance (DA), which he also called an “enemy of the people” (Horwitz 2016, 543). More generally, Melama and the EFF have asserted the organs of the state itself were hostile to the ordinary people. In its first election campaign in 2014 the party played heavily on the clash between striking platinum miners and police in Marikana, which left 34 of the former killed, as a iconic revelation of the way that the ANC had sold out to capital (Mbete 2015, 41; Nyenhuis 2020, 419). He was later ejected from parliament for saying that the ANC had “murdered” the miners (Mbete 2015, 51). The EFF has campaigned with a highly confrontational style, often linking with protests in various cities and towns (Hurt and Kuisma 2016, 12; Mbete 2015; Adams 2018, 116). In each of its categorisations of the political elite, Malema and the EFF asserted a conspiratorial tone, accusing the elites of “stealing from the poor” for their own benefit (Nyenhuis 2020, 420) (OTH_POLCLASS = 3).\nShunning the post-1994 ANC’s rainbow nation narrative, the EFF “discard[ed] any pretence of support for non-racialism” (Everatt 2016, 58), and “equated elitism with race” (Resnick 2018, 276). The party has explicitly defined its “people” as black Africans (Mbete 2015, 41), and often referred to “whites” in categorical terms as the people’s enemy (Akinola, Oluwaseum, and Tolulope 2015, 109). Party posters included slogans like “’the honeymoon is over for whites,” and Malema has stated that white South Africans were collectively “thieves” (Mbete 2015, 36) and “criminals” (Akinola, Oluwaseum, and Tolulope 2015, 107; Welz and Kromrey 2015, 268) for their possession the nation’s land and assets. In practice, the concept of the white racial elite and the rich were merged in Malema’s discourse (forming “economic apartheid”) (Oso 2020, 251; Essop 2015, 214; Fölscher, de Jager, and Nyenhuis 2021, 543), in the same way that the black racial majority was merged with the working class (Hurt and Kuisma 2016, 14; Mbete 2015, 41). Malema has accused his black critics of being “coconuts” who are “not really black” (Glaser 2011, 73–74), and in the 2019 election accused Ramaphosa of wanting “to sound white, because you do not believe in the total liberation of African children” (Nyenhuis 2020, 419) (OTH_ETHNIC = 3).\nAlongside the political and racial elite, big business and capital were considered as key enemies of the people to the EFF (Horwitz 2016, 548; Hurt and Kuisma 2016). The party’s 2014 election manifesto describes itself as “anti-capitalist”, and states the party’s goal to\n\nemancipate [workers] from economic subjugation and oppression. The African working class suffered and continue to suffer excessive levels of oppression and exploitation as Mineworkers, Farm workers, underpaid Domestic workers, Petrol Attendants, Private Security Guards, and constitute the large pool of reserve labourers as they are [unemployed] (cited in Phadi 2020, 420).\n\nThe party called a minister “a dog of white monopoly capital” (Phadi 2020, 425). For this we have coded them 3 on OTH_FINANCIAL.\nNot a lot is written about the EFF and immigration, but some scholars have noted that it has avoided xenophobic attacks on immigrants in South Africa, taking an “open and pan-Africanist approach to immigration, rather than a purely nationalist stance on the issue” (Hurt and Kuisma 2016, 2). After episodes of violence against foreign immigrants and refugees (particularly Zimbabweans) in South Africa, Malema has been a notable voice of opposition, claiming that he “did not want a vote of xenophobes” (Asuelime 2020, 14622), and criticising black South African’s who championed the global Black Lives Matter movement while not caring about violence against African migrants (Ruzungunde and Zhou 2021, 7). Though they were highly critical of the police, we’ve seen no evidence that they were hostile to the military (OTH_MILITARY = 1). The party’s manifesto mentions its “anti-imperialism”, but not that the domestic elite represents foreign powers (OTH_FOREIGN = 1)\nEFF policy is considered by Fakir to have been a “hodge-podge of different ideological and political strains melding the incendiary politics of ‘radical blackness’ with the seeming elements of socialism” (Fakir 2014, 4). While some have associated the party with fascism (Satgar 2019), the party (as its name suggests) usually tends to be considered far left (Hurt and Kuisma 2016; Yende 2021; Fölscher, de Jager, and Nyenhuis 2021, 543) owing to its stated policy of nationalising assets like farms, mines, and banks without compensation, as well as other conventionally left leaning economic policies (Mbete 2015, 39; Adams 2018, 115). We’ve concurred with this, and labelled it FL on LRPOSITION.\nThe party is widely considered to be tied to Malema’s charismatic personality and his remarkable ability to command media attention (Mbete 2015, 35; 2020, 241; Roberts 2019, 101; Gunner 2015). Malema is the party’s “Commander in Chief” (Horwitz 2016, 543), and some consider a “cult of personality” to have formed around him (Calland and Seedat 2015, 305). One study of local branch members showed the centrality of Malema’s personality in the motivation of members’ participation (Essop 2015, 222). (CHARISMA = 3). Given Malema’s closeness to Jacob Zuma in the early years of the latter’s presidency, there could be an argument that he served as an “insider” in government at that time. We don’t think this is sufficient to register on our INSIDER scale, and have thus coded the EFF 1.\nFor several reasons, many scholars have considered the EFF to be threat to liberal democratic norms in South Africa. Malema has repeatedly made threats of violence against rivals, such as: threatening to “cut the throat” of a Democratic Alliance mayor (Horwitz 2016, 543); telling a crowd in 2016 that “we’re not calling for the slaughter of white people, at least for now” (Hitchcock-Lopez 2019, 319); celebrating attacks on white farmers (Morrell, Jewkes, and Lindegger 2012, 18); and encouraging supporters to “go to parliament… and shoot them randomly” (Horwitz 2016, 550). Perhaps the most notorious example is his singing of the anti-Apartheid era song “Shoot the Boer”, for which he was found guilty of hate speech (Akinola, Oluwaseum, and Tolulope 2015, 108). The party’s 2014 advertisements were banned for calling for the physical destruction of highway toll booths (Mbete 2015, 43). This is in keeping with the party’s self-identification as “militant” in its 2014 election manifesto (Horwitz 2016, 543). The combination of its uniforms (with red berets), its designation of Malema as “Commander in Chief” (Horwitz 2016, 543), and its rigid command structure (Paret 2018, 477) has given the party a “performatively militaristic” style (Nieftagodien 2015, 447). The EFF has also undermined parliamentary procedures, disrupting sittings and refusing to show up to disciplinary hearings. (Horwitz 2016, 543; Roberts 2019, 99; Yende 2021, 59), sometimes leading to violent altercations with the chamber’s security (Hurt and Kuisma 2016, 11). One such interruption was during President Zuma’s State of the Nation Address in 2015 (Calland and Seedat 2015, 304). Ideologically, Malema has a history of illiberal majoritarianism (Vincent 2011, 4–5), and party spokespeople have claimed that they want to create a “one-party system” (Horwitz 2016, 543; Fölscher, de Jager, and Nyenhuis 2021, 543). We find this sufficient evidence to code the party 3 on LIBDEMNORMS.\nReferences\nAdams, Rachel. 2018. “South Africa’s Social Contract: The Economic Freedom Fighters and the Rise of a New Constituent Power?” Acta Academica: Critical Views on Society, Culture and Politics 50 (3): 102–21.\nAkinola, Adeoye O., Tella Oluwaseum, and Adeogun Tolulope. 2015. “From Reformist to Pugnacious Rhetoric: Julius Malema and the South African Political Space.” Gandhi Marg Quarterly 37 (1): 103–20.\nAsuelime, Raquel A. 2020. “Ubuntu and Xenophobia Incongruities and the 2019 South African Elections Impetus.” Gender & Behaviour 18 (1): 14621–30.\nBassett, Carolyn, and Marlea Clarke. 2008. “The Zuma Affair, Labour and the Future of Democracy in South Africa.” Third World Quarterly 29 (4): 787–803.\nCalland, Richard, and Shameela Seedat. 2015. “Institutional Renaissance or Populist Fandango?

    "text": "Carlos Menem\nArgentina suffered a coup by the military that overthrew the Peronist government of Isabel Perón and imposed a military dictatorship. The first free elections after the coup took place in 1983 and Raul Alfonsín became president until 1989, when he was succeeded by Carlos Menem. Carlos Menem is a complicated figure. Most authors agree that he won the 1989 election running a campaign based on the traditional Peronist discourse articulated around the concepts of “salariazo” and “the revolution of production” (Burdman, 2008: 10). In this victory speech, for instance, Menem proclaimed his was the victory of the “heroic march of national unity to be protagonist of a historic battle that all Argentinians must undertake ... against privileges, against vested interests, against speculators and usurers, against those who seek that nothing changes so that misery, underdevelopment, poverty and hunger continue in the Argentinian Republic” (Menem, 1989b). He also proclaimed that “my only compromise is to achieve the happiness of the Argentinian people and the greatness of the fatherland” (Menem, 1989b). Hawkins and Rovira Kaltwasser (2017) argue that his 1989 campaign indeed showed signs of a Manichean division between the elite and the people.\nFair (2011: 2) argues that Menem initiated a timid dialogue with the military, stressed the need for peace and hinted that he would indult the military, as he later did. Menem stressed his commitment to democracy by arguing that they, as opposed to the radical party, were the only ones holding primary elections in their party (Menem, 1989a). Burdam (2008: 13) argues that although Menem stressed the need to achieve economic independence this did not meant, as it did with Perón, freedom from the dependence vis-à-vis the UK, but simply the modernization of the economy and the level of production, without addressing who owns the capital. Therefore, I have coded 1 for military, LD norms violation and Foreign Interests.\nHowever, Menem quickly shifted his economic discourse and embraced neoliberal policies devoted to control inflation. This fact has sparked the debate on Menem’s populism. For those authors who defend a more substantive definition of populism (Hawkins and Rovira Kaltwasser, 2017; Levitsky, 2003) Menem should not be considered populist after 1989. Neoliberal policies are considered to be opposed to neoliberalism and Menem is portrayed as betraying its previous populist stance. Moreover, Hawkins and Rovira Kaltwasser (2017) find little Manichean discourse between the elite and the people in his 1995 campaign. For authors that define populism based on personalism, a direct connection with the people, concentration of power and transgressing liberal political norms (Weyland, 2003: 6, 1996; Wehner, 2004) and less on substantive elements, neoliberalism and populism have a number of synergies. These include low levels of institutionalization, targeting unorganized poor, distancing themselves from unions, professional organizations and business groups and the use of the state to push through reform against opposition (Weyland, 2003: 2-3). Menem presented itself as a courageous leader that attacked the crisis head-on and thus deliver the country from hyperinflation demonstrating and reinforced his charisma (Weyland, 2003: 4). This author argues that “when the country confronted a deep open crisis and neoliberals prescribed the shock therapy of drastic market reform, they relied on the boldness and transgressive tendencies of neo-populist leaders to carry out this plan of action” (Weyland 2003: 5). Moreover, it was this boldness in the initial crisis what may explain their downfall as inflation lost importance compared to unemployment and growth, areas where neoliberal policies fare less well (Weyland 2003; Wehner, 2004). This understanding of the connection of neoliberalism and neo-populism is not very far from Hall’s and Jacques’s (1983) understanding of the politics of Thatcher.\nWehner (2004: 41) attributes Menem’s 1995 reelection to the relatively good results of his neoliberal economic policies. High inflation had been huge problem during Alfonsín’s government and, although poverty and employment did not improve, Menem’s ability to control inflation was rewarded by the Argentinian voters (Wehner, 2004: 46). In government, he had proclaimed an amnesty to militaries involved in the dictatorship and promoted close relationships with the EEUU in what was known as “relaciones carnales” through, for example, participating in the invasion to Kuwait (Botta, 2012: 157).\nI have coded Menem in 1989. However, I have finally ruled against including him the rest of his years in government due to its lack of Manichean distinction between elite and people and his more pluralist understanding of politics."

    "section": "Néstor Kirchner",
    "text": "Néstor Kirchner\nIn 2001, Argentina suffered a very strong economic and political crisis provoked by the “corralito” (which severely restricted people's ability to withdraw cash from banks). Widespread anger against the political system was summed in the motto \"All of them must go!\" (“¡Que se vayan todos!”). The election of Néstor Kirchner in 2003 as president of Argentina can be seen as the political outcome of that crisis. Néstor ran a campaign based on an opposition to the “old political class” and the “Fatherland’s enemies” (Padoan, 2017: 533; Fernández, 2010: 205). He argued for a radical change in the political system, the retrieval of the traditional Peronists goals of “Economic Independency”, “Political Sovereignty” and “Social Justice” (Padoan, 2017: 533) and criticized the Peronists of the 1990s for not delivering their promises and betraying Perón (Kirchner, 2003). Néstor condemned harshly the human rights abuses of the military dictatorship and the presidents before him for not prosecuting their crimes. Thus, once in government, he revoked the “Law of Due Obedience” and the “Full Stop law” and renewed the military hierarchy because the previous one was seen as part of the establishment (Fernández, 2010: 202). I have coded 3 for political class and for military.\nEconomically, Néstor argued forcefully against the neoliberal reforms that Menem had implemented in the previous decade. Kirchner proclaimed the need to rethink the economic system and, in his investment speech, talked about constructing a “National capitalism” (Kirchner, 2003b; Padoan, 2017: 533). The central issue in his economic and international policies was the payment of Argentina’s debt. Argentina had accrued a huge debt problem and Néstor’s solution consisted mainly on restructuring it. He famously proclaimed that “the creditors have to understand that they will only get paid if Argentina performs well” (Kirchner, 2003b; Fernández, 2010: 206). He managed to restructure 76% of the debt in 2005 and then Cristina did it again in 2010 up to 92% (Fernández de Kirchner, 2014). The main construction of a foreign enemy was done precisely on this point. Kirchnerism focuses less on attacks on specific foreign others but calls into question the whole international economic system that promotes neoliberal policies. Therefore, their attacks are mainly directed towards international economic institutions such as the IMF and against the financial elite (both national and international) who is blamed for pressuring in favor of policies that damage “the people” (Fernández, 2010). In Cristina’s presidency this opposition to foreign intervention was exemplified by the conflict over US judge Thomas Griesa’ decision over the payment of the debt to creditors.\nThere is no important ethnic other for Kirchnerism and immigrants have not been identified as the enemy of the people. In fact, Cristina has had a welcoming stance towards immigration (Irigaray, 2014). In order to underlie that their opposition to foreign interest are intrinsically connected with their economic position and not with specific enemy countries, I have marked a 3 for Financial and Foreign Interests, 1 for Immigration and Ethnic Other and “left-wing” as political ideology.\nNéstor Kirchner was an unknown governor of a province when, in 2003, he launched his campaign (code 1 for insider populism in 2003). He was endorsed by exiting president Eduardo Duhalde, in a move to stop Carlos Menem from winning. He started with a 6% share in the polls and ended with a 22%. Thus, the social demand for a left-wing protest party produced by the devastating effects of the “corralito” may explain better Kirchner’s success than his charisma. However, the personality cult around Kirchner should not be discarded and “kirchnerism” became the name for the specific branch of populism developed by Néstor and Cristina. Moreover, Kirchner won the election with a party coalition (Front for Victory) and later constructed its party support not just from the traditional Justicialist Party, but from a very diverse mix of groups, governors and people from different ideologies. The only unifying figure of this coalition was Néstor Kirchner himself (Schurman, 2006). Thus, I have coded 1 for the first election and 2 for the rest in the category Personality Dependent.\nAlthough she held no position in government, since Cristina was Néstor’s wife, a member of the Senate before her 2007 campaign and participated actively in her husband’s political decisions, she can be considered as belonging to the “inner-circle” of power before running in 2007. Therefore, I have coded her as a 3. Scioli’s campaign and personal position as Vice-president, although not identical, can be considered largely as a continuation of Cristina’s Kirchnerism and his campaign was read as such by the population (Smink, 2015)."

    "text": "The Intransigent Party and FrePaSo\nThe Intransigent Party was a branch of the Radical Civic Union and which obtained its best result in the legislative elections of 1985. As its foundational document states, their principles are “popular participation, economic nationalism, social justice and Latin American integration” (Intransigent Party, 1975: 30). They argued in favor of an anti-imperialist revolution that would transform capitalism and liberate the people (Intransigent Party, 1975: 37).\nFrePaSo is a coalition of parties that included Peronists that were critic with Menem, Frente Grande, the Communist party, the Intransigent party and Christian democrats. The party obtained good results in 1995 in both the legislative and the presidential elections. Bordon’s rhetoric stressed the need for a “serious and responsible” political proposal based on the “work culture” and promised “honesty, austerity and capacity to recognize when I make a mistake” (Neustadt, 1995). The presidential candidate abandoned the party the following year. Koessl (2009) argues that FrePaSo’s success was due to the internal problems of the UCR, Menem’s neoliberal policies and the pact between these parties (“Pacto de Olivos”) which gave the impression that there was no political opposition to the bipartisan system. It is precisely this image as a political alternative what explains its success but the party’s rhetoric, particularly that of its leader, is difficult to classify as populist. Thus, I have not added the party in the list.\nReferences\nBotta, Paulo (2012) “Argentina e Irán entre 1989 y 1999: Entre las sombras de los atentados terroristas y el cambio de política exterior argentina”, Araucaria.

In 1992, the young and charismatic Manuel Monteiro assumed the party leadership and added the name “People’s Party” (Partido Popular, henceforth CDS-PP). Monteiro moved the party toward the ideological right and embraced a populist discourse. This precipitated a turnaround of party fortunes, with its vote share rising from 4.4 to 9.1 between the 1991 and 1995 elections. There seems to be little evidence that the party was populist before or after Monteiro’s leadership - Lisi & Borghetto call it “mainstream” in 2018 (Lisi and Borghetto 2018, 407). Monteiro went on to found another party – the New Democracy Party – in 2003, but this did not achieve much success.\nThere are not many expansive texts in English discussing the CDS-PP’s populism at length, but several references give evidence as to the broad elements of Monteiro’s populist discourse. The party’s 1995 election manifesto claimed that “Two classes of citizens are present in Portugal: the politicians, who have used the law to get more and more privileges, and the rest, who work an entire life, pay taxes and do not get access to any of them” (Lisi and Borghetto 2018, 414). Similarly, several scholars point to Mandeiro’s will to “mobilise protest by targeting the sectors of the population disillusioned with the two main parties” (De Sousa 2001, 179; see also Salgado and Zúquete 2016, 238–39), suggesting a strong presence on the OTH_POLCLASS variable (= 3).\nMonteiro positioned the party on the right (LRPOSITION = R) in an attempt to garner the nationalist vote (Corkill 1996, 406), and adopted conservative stances on crime and social issues. This also included a strong Euroscepticism (Corkill 1996, 406; Costa Lobo 2003, 109; Costa Lobo and Magalhães 2011, 90) on nationalist, pro-sovereignty grounds (OTH_FOREIGN = 2), and anti-immigrant policies (Salgado and Zúquete 2016, 239) (OTH_IMMIGRANT = 2). We have not found evidence to suggest OTH_ETHNIC or OTH_FINANCIAL variables (= 1), but further research should confirm this.\nThe party was in coalition government in the 1970s, but given that Monteiro was not a part of that government we have coded the party 1 on INSIDER for the 1995 election. While the party has been established since the 1970s, several texts make it clear that Monteiro’s leadership and “belligerent” style (The Economist Intelligence Unit 1998, 13) was a central component of its image and appeal (CHARISMA = 2). Monteiro suggested that popular militias could fight crime (Corkill 1996, 406) and that drug addicts be “interned” in treatment clinics (The Economist Intelligence Unit 1997, 15), for which we have coded him 2 on LIBDEMNORMS.\nLeft Bloc\nThe Left Bloc (Bloco de Esquerda, BE) is the product of a 1999 merger of two small far left parties – the Revolutionary Socialist Party and the Popular Democratic Union. According to Lisi, the party was created to overcome the fractured nature of the Portuguese left, and to appeal to independents dissatisfied with the incumbent socialist government (Lisi 2009, 131). In contrast to the established Portuguese Communist Party, it showed more interest in “left-libertarian” (post-materialist) values, a willingness to link with other social movements (Lisi 2009, 132), and a move away from Marxian ideas of class conflict toward a more general “interclassist” approach (Lisi and Borghetto 2018, 418) (LRPOSITION = L). The party’s fortunes increased during the economic crisis in 2010-11 and the government’s controversial austerity package that followed it (Lisi 2013, 33; Lisi and Borghetto 2018, 420).\nThere are few sources which detail the nature of the party’s anti-establishment rhetoric, but there seems to be a general consensus in the literature that it is an anti-establishment populist party that reaps protest votes from dissatisfied voters (Gómez-Reino Cachafeiro and Plaza-Colodro 2018, 351; Silva 2018; March 2008, 11; Soeiro 2009, 183; Lisi and Borghetto 2018, 413) (OTH_POLCLASS = 3). At its foundation, the party aimed to be a highly decentralised “political movement of citizens” in contrast to the traditional left-wing parties and their rigid hierarchies (Lisi 2013, 25), and to harvest protest votes against the incumbent government (Lisi 2009, 135). In advertising campaigns throughout the post-crisis protests, the party accused the established parties of being unrepresentative and unresponsive (Lisi 2013, 34; 2009, 132). Lisi also suggests that both anti-establishment appeal and far left ideology dissipated after the conservative government came to power in 2003 (Lisi 2009, 136) – this should be further investigated.\nIn keeping with its leftist ideology, the party is hostile to business and financial elites (Soeiro 2009, 180; Lisi and Borghetto 2018, 420) (OTH_FINANCIAL = 3). The party also maintains a generally Eurosceptic stance (Gómez-Reino Cachafeiro and Plaza-Colodro 2018, 351). In its 2005 manifesto, it claimed that “In today’s Europe, where Berlin’s power is the only rule, the defence of democracy is the people’s weapon against blackmail” (Lisi and Borghetto 2018, 417) (OTH_FOREIGN = 2). Further research should discuss whether this rating should remain constant throughout the party’s period of inclusion in the dataset. We have seen no evidence for any coding above 1 on either LIBDEMNORMS or CHARISMA, and the party has never been in government (INSIDER = 1).\nReferences\nCorkill, David. 1996. ‘Portugal Votes for Change and Stability: The Election of 1995’.

That state institutions have so consistently sought to suppress Islamist politics has provided a context in which Islamist parties can easily paint populist “anti system” narratives about themselves and the political class (Cizre and Çınar 2003, 310), and it often seems that Islamism is more relevant as a token of this social division than as a force of genuine religiosity or theocracy (M. H. Yavuz 1997, 74). This pattern can be traced in Turkey through the Democrat Party, the National Order Party, the National Salvation Party and since 1980 through the Welfare Party, the Virtue Party, the Felicity Party and the Justice and Development Party – each of which was linked in some way to its predecessor (often including leaders and structures)."

    "text": "The Welfare Party\nThe Welfare Party (Refah Partisi, WP) was led by veteran Islamist politician Necmettin Erbakan, who had previously led several other Islamist parties which were banned by constitutional courts. The party emerged in the late 1980s and won a plurality in the 1995 general elections. According to Ayata, the narratives of the WP stressed the role of western imperial powers in the humiliation and backwardness of rural Turkish Muslims, and advocated Islamism as the only redemptive path (Ayata 1996, 54). The party’s “Just Order” platform actually focused heavily on social justice and the plight of the poor – even more than leftist parties – than on theocratic advocacy, and built on the supposed contempt that the coastal and urban liberal elite had for the masses (Ayata 1996, 54; White 1997, 26). That said, we’ve seen no evidence that the wealthy themselves were a ‘class’ of other that the party countered, and it seems to have left some discursive space for capitalist accumulation in its literature (Onis 1997, 753) and had significant connections to Islamic business elites (Onis 1997, 758; Gülalp 2001, 439) (OTH_FINANCIAL = 1). According to Onis (Onis 1997, 753) the party’s rhetoric against the West was “relentless”, and it consistently accused the established parties of being “imitators of the West” (OTH_FOREIGN = 3)\nIn the lead up to the 1995 election, Erbakan refused to share a debate stage with the major party leaders on the grounds that they were all imitators of the West (Onis 1997, 755), continuing its hard anti-political class rhetoric that built a “WP vs the Rest” narrative (OTH_POLCLASS = 3). While the party connected Islam with the homogenous “people” (M. H. Yavuz 1997, 67), we’ve coded it 3 on OTH_ETHNIC – although given it actually had a pan-ethnic identity and sought votes from Kurdish areas, there is a case that this should be 2, and that the party is essentially anti-political class, business elites and foreign intervention. This difficulty speaks to the complicated role of Islamist rhetoric in defining “people” in Turkey. Despite the fact that the military has been so closely involved in the secular liberal political establishment that WP opposed, we cannot see any evidence that it constituted an “other” for the party (OTH_MILITARY = 1). It should also be stressed that the combination of religious identity and leftish economic platforms make the party very difficult to characterise on a L-R scale (Onis 1997, 753) – for now we’ve coded it as R. The party had no prior position in power (INSIDER = 1) and there is no evidence that the charisma of its leaders was particularly relevant to its populist discourse (CHARISMA = 1)."

    "section": "The Virtue Party",
    "text": "The Virtue Party\nThe Virtue Party (Fazilet Partisi VP) was created by the Welfare Party leadership when it was banned by a constitutional court decision in 1997. While the Erbakan and several other leaders could not lead the new party, they had a significant say over its direction and virtually controlled it. However, the VP sharply shifted its tone from the WP, most notably by enthusiastically embracing EU membership and removing the anti-Western discourse from its ideology (OTH_FOREIGN = 1). This was arguably because it saw EU legal protections as the only thing that could curb the Turkish state’s continual intervention against Islamist political parties (Taniyici 2003, 476). The party also sought to soften its Islamist image, indicating a relaxing of various platforms and even hiring several women into its leadership to show its more secular credentials (Mecham 2004, 348) (OTH_ETHNIC = 1). It is not clear however that there was any softening of its anti-political class rhetoric (OTH_POLCLASS = 3). As Mecham puts it:\n\nVirtue found its new voice as an opposition party by shifting from the old claim that Turkey was not religious enough to the claim that Turkey was not democratic enough. Both charges attempted to frame the Turkish regime as illegitimate to some degree, but the charges of poor democracy sought to engage the secular democratic system on its own terms (Mecham 2004, 346).\n\nThat said, the variation in all of these variables is tricky to code because many in Turkey saw the party as a continuation of Welfare, and considered its softening of rhetoric to be more strategic than genuine. The party was split between Erbakan loyalists and reformers (including Abdullah Gul and Recep Tayyip Erdogan), who became increasingly antagonistic before the 1999 election (Mecham 2004, 347) and ended up forming separate parties after Virtue was banned in 2001 (Felicity Party and Truth and Justice respectively)."

    "text": "Justice and Development Party\nThe Justice and Development Party (Adalet ve Kalkınma Partisi, AKP) was founded in 2001 by former Istanbul mayor Recep Tayyip Erdogan, then one of the most popular politicians in the country. The name “AK Party” utilised the Turkish word ak, which means both “white” and “clean”, symbolising the party’s commitment to renew the impure and corrupt Turkish state (Mecham 2004, 349). It initially maintained Virtue’s more moderate expressions of Islamist identity (Dagi 2008, 29), but shed the Welfare/Virtue Islamic logos in favour of a simple light bulb, and made a point of recruiting more (non-headscarf-wearing) women into leadership positions (Mecham 2004, 353). Erdogan and the AKO have remained the dominant forces in Turkish politics since it took power in the 2002 elections with 34.3% of the vote.\nAttempting to capture the more mainstream centre-right vote, AKP campaigned against corruption in the Turkish state and advocated religious liberty (maintaining the importance of Islam as a social institution) while accepting the secular principles of the state and shedding some its “anti-system” aura. However Erdogan’s Welfare background and several comments he made in the 2002 race meant that anti-political class rhetoric was still a significant part of the party’s identity. In the party’s 2002 election campaign, for example, Erdogan said:\n\nMy story is the story of this people. Either the people will win and come to power, or the pretentious and oppressive minority estranged from the reality of Anatolia and looking over it with disdain will remain in power. The authority to decide on this belongs to the people. Enough is enough, sovereignty belongs to the people (Aytaç and Öniş 2014, 45).\n\nIn its first election we have decided to code it 2 on the OTH_POLCLASS variable (see Çarkoğlu 2002, 39; Gürsoy 2021, 166).\nIn its early days the party was stridently pro-EU membership – more so than Virtue. Despite this, various personal legacies of Erdogan and Gül’s time in Welfare/Virtue – Erdogan is on record in 1994 saying that one could either be a secularist or a Muslim, but not both (see Mecham 2004, 247) – meant that the Islamist brand was still somewhat established, and the party at this point was still essentially an Islamist protest party in the Welfare tradition. Several scholars have pointed out the nativist (Kaya, Robert, and Tecmen 2020, 363) and ethnically exclusionary nature of this majoritarian narrative (Arat-Koç 2018; Gürsoy 2021). For this the party deserves a 2 for OTH_ETHNIC. Opposition to immigrants, however, have not been an important component of AKP’s discourse (Gürsoy 2021, 161) (OTH_IMMIGRANTS =1). According to Gürsoy “in the early years of AKP rule, ‘the elite’ meant most fundamentally the secular military and judicial establishment.” (OTH_MILITARY = 3 from 2002), but it was only after 2007 that foreign enemies were elevated to the primary enemies of the people. By the 2018 elections, Erdogan and the AKP were characterising their domestic rivals as the “domestic collaborators” of Turkey’s foreign enemies (Sözen 2019, 12; see also Gürsoy 2021, 166) (OTH_FOREIGN = 1 in 2002, 3 from 2007).\nIt is difficult to pinpoint the time when AK started veering off into a sharper populist tone with more defined denemies. We have settled on the 2007 snap election which followed the crisis of electing the president (done by parliament). Here it seems that threats of intervention by the military angered Erdogan who responded by leveraging his now well-established base of popular support against them explicitly in a “people/nation” vs. ’secularists/institutions” narrative during the campaign (Dinçşahin 2012; Elçi 2019, 5). Note that some scholars (Yabanci 2016, 599) suggest that the constitutional referendum in 2010 and the 2013 Gezi park protests as the key turning point. Whatever the precise turning point, by the 2015 elections Erdogan had transitioned to a clearer populist anti-elite discourse on a number fronts, criticising all other politicians, media intellectuals as part of an elite tied to previous corruption and maladministration, and sharply criticising the western media, particularly over their criticism of the 2013 Gezi protests (Erçetin and Erdoğan 2018) (OTH_POLCLASS = 3 2007-). This was packaged in his rhetoric around the “New Turkey” (post constitutional reforms) in which the Kemalist establishment was cast as remnants of the “Old Turkey” (Selçuk 2016, 577). According to Selçuk political opponents were increasingly portrayed as “traitors to the nation” or “coup sympathisers” (the latter after the 2016 coup attempt) (Selçuk 2016; see also Gürsoy 2021, 166–67).\nLiberal democratic norms are also difficult to track with AK. We think the best point to elevate LIBDEMNORMS to a 2 is the 2010 period, where according to Yabanci attacks on the media in particular escalated (Yabanci 2016). We have further elevated this to a 3 after the coup attempt in 2016. Further research into AK should determine whether its religious populist rhetoric has increased back to the scale of Welfare in the 1990s. The literature suggest that Erdogan has always been the charismatic central figure in the representation of the party (Elçi 2019, 5; Kaya, Robert, and Tecmen 2020, 370; Selçuk, Hekimci, and Erpul 2019; Sawae 2020, 261)(CHARISMA = 3). While the party has a complicated policy profile, we agree with the general view of the literature that it is a right-wing party to its cultural majoritarianism and nationalism (LRPOSITION = R)."

    "text": "The Young Party\nThe Young Party (Genç Parti, GP), was a one-man-show led by businessman and media mogul Cem Uzan, who railed against the establishment and promised impossible benefits to voters (Çarkoğlu 2002, 39), and is generally considered populist (Robins 2003, 550) and “Berlusconi-like” (Kaya 2003, 208) in the literature. GP only mustered 7.3% of the vote in 2002, below the 10% needed to enter parliament in a race dominated by the ascendency of the AKP. He returned in 2007 but only won 3% of the vote.\nAll sources suggest Uzan was extremely hostile to the political establishment (Çarkoğlu 2002, 39), and is occasionally considered “anti-system” (Kaya 2003, 208) (OTH_POLCLASS = 3). The party was also considered “ultra-nationalist” (Başlevent, Ki̇rmanoğlu, and Şenatalar 2005, 548; Baykan 2018) and hostile to the IMF (in the context of Turkey’s economic crisis) (Rubin 2005), which Uzan claimed was colonizing Turkey (Gökçen, Homer, and Oates 2006, 266). He was also highly critical of the IMF, World Bank, the USA, and the EU (Kaya 2003, 208; Küçük 2018, 578), whom he considered opposed to the nation. For this we have labelled the party 2 on OTH_FOREIGN, but further research should determine the precise nature of this nationalist rhetoric. A backstory here is Uzan’s commercial dispute with Motorola, which featured heavily in both the media and his campaign. We’ve seen no evidence in the secondary literature that for GP to register on the OTH_ETHNIC or OTH_IMMIGRANTS variables (both = 1).\nGP was seen as a nationalist competitor to the Nationalist Action Party (Robins 2003, 550), but also toward the centre of the spectrum due to the something-for-everyone nature of its policies (Çarkoğlu 2002, 39; Carcoglu 2006, 165). The literature variously considers it “right wing” (Muftuler-Bac 2003, 428), “conservative nationalist” (Kaya 2003, 208) and “centre right” (Küçük 2018, 577). We have labelled it centre-right (LRPOSITION = CR). In place of any considered policy agenda, the GP is universally considered a “one-man show” (Çarkoğlu 2002, 39) dominated by Cem’s flamboyant personality and reliant on his media organisation (CHARISMA = 3). According to Çarkoğlu, Uzan’s campaign violated several electoral laws with impunity (Çarkoğlu 2002, 39), and although this evidence could be corroborated we’ve coded it 2 on LIBDEMNORMS."

    "text": "Not included\nThe Nationalist Action Party (Milliyetçi Hareket Partisi, MHP) is a very difficult party to code by our definitions. It is a radically nationalist party, socially conservative, statist, anti-globalisation and critical to both European and Russian threats to the Turkish national interest. Its traditional enemies foreigners and their domestic collaborators, who include leftists, Kurds, Alevi Muslims, and liberal intellectuals (M. Yavuz 2002, 206). The party paramilitary links, and has celebrated various former militia members (Cınar and Arıkan 2002, 73). The party’s radical nationalism has a Manichean proportion as it has discussed threats to the nation and the party’s role in saving it, and in doing so it has generally spoken for the true Turkish people in a holistic sense (Erdoğan and Uyan-Semerci 2020). It has also used acerbic rhetoric against opponents, whom it has accused of “treason” among other things (Selçuk, Hekimci, and Erpul 2019, 556). However we have not found enough evidence that the party was ever opposed to an “elite” governing the country against the people’s interests. Instead, the party has considered itself an ally of the state. Erdoğan and Uyan-Semerci, who have looked specifically into the potential populism of the MHP under long-time leader Devlet Bahçeli, conclude simply that “For Bahçeli, the elites of Turkey are not among the usual enemies of the nation” (Erdoğan and Uyan-Semerci 2020). On this basis we’ve elected not to include the BHP in the dataset, as it appears to be far right but not populist by our definition.

H. Douglas. Social Credit went through many different phases as a party, but achieved its best result of 20.65% in 1981 under the leadership of Bruce Beetham. The party gradually declined after that, and by the 1987 election it had changed its name to the Democratic Party.\nGustafson (Gustafson 2006, 61) and Miller (Miller 1997, 168) both suggest that under Beetham Social Credit Party was a fundamentally populist party given its conspiratorial hostility to financial elites. The party advocated financial reform and was built on a mainly rural and religious voter base. Its policies were a complicated balance of hostility to financial elites (OTH_FINANCIAL = 3) and a libertarian distrust in state bureaucrats (Davis 1980, 3). While there is some opposition to the political class in this, Beetham’s stated conciliatory strategy of working with opponents (Davis 1980, 4) makes him difficult to and the party a somewhat awkward fit for OTH_POLCLASS. We’ve coded Social Credit 2 on this variable, but more evidence of his campaigning language would help to clarify this. Beetham was highly critical of the IMF based global monetary system (Davis 1980, 3), but it would be a stretch to say that this constitutes a register on the OTH_FOREIGN variable (= 1). We’ve seen no evidence of anything for OTH_ETHNIC, OTH_IMMIGRANT or OTH_MILITARY.\nWhile it seems to have been personally dominated by Beetham, the party had a well-established base of support and ideology before his ascendance, and hence we’ve coded it 2 on CHARISMA in 1981 and 1984, and 1 in the 1987 election after it parted with Beetham. We’ve seen no evidence to code above 1 for INSIDER or LIBDEMNORMS. The party is very difficult to code ideologically, but given the primacy of its criticisms of the economic system we’ve coded it CL."

    "text": "New Zealand Party\nThe New Zealand Party (NZP) was founded by a group of business leaders before the 1984 election to advocate for neo-liberal policies at odds with the conservative National Party government. It soon became a personal vehicle for its leader, brash property mogul and former National financier Bob Jones. The NZP tallied 12% in the 1984 vote, where its main effect was allegedly to take votes away from National and put the Labour opposition into government (Roy 1986). Before the following election Jones claimed to be satisfied with the neo-liberal economic policies of the Labour government and withdrew from the party, precipitating its decline.\nIt is debatable whether Jones’ campaign narrative quite reaches the threshold for our minimum definition of populism, or whether his antipathy to elites was a combination of his singular grudge with incumbent Prime Minister Robert Muldoon and his neo-liberal ideological opposition to state power. We have included him mainly on the work of Gustafson, who suggests that Jones “detested state intervention and control and the interference of bureaucratic regulators, politically correct busybodies, traffic officers and journalists in his life” (Gustafson 2006, 59). In that capacity he accused Muldoon of being a “dictator” (Pugh 1984, 312). Given that this is less consistent than more conspiratorial narratives against the political class, we’ve coded NZP 2 on OTH_POLCLASS. We’ve seen no evidence for coding above 1 for OTH_ETHNIC, OTH_IMMIGRATS, OTH_FOREIGN, OTH_FINANCIAL, or OTH MILITARY.\nThe NZP’s image was built around Jones’ “explosive personality” (Martin 1984, 394), such that soon after its launch it became known as the “Jones Party” (Aimer 1988, 3) (CHARISMA =3). The party included some left-libertarian positions, but it is broadly considered right wing due to the primacy of its neo-liberal economic positions (Martin 1984, 394) (LRPOSITION = R). Jones had not held any position in government before his campaign, even though he and Muldoon were “old mates” (Simpson 1986, 266). Jones famously punched a journalist the year after the election and was notably hostile to the media on the campaign trail, but we don’t think this quite rises to a violation of liberal democratic norms (LIBDEMNORMS = 1)."

    "text": "New Zealand First\nNew Zealand First (NZF) was formed by outspoken former National Party MP and minister Winston Peters in 1992 after he left his former party in opposition to its economic policy. NZF won 8.4% in the election the following year, which increased to its peak of 13.4% the following election before hovering around the high-single digits for most of the following two decades. Peters is known for his crass and abrasive style, offering personal criticisms of journalists and fellow politicians. The party has thrice played the part of kingmaker in minority governments led by both major parties, leading Peters to serve as Deputy PM and Treasurer 1996-98 (with the Nationals), and twice as Minister for Foreign affairs 2005-08 and 2017-present (both times with Labour).\nGiven his longevity on the political scene in New Zealand, coupled with his movement in and out of government (MacDonald 2022), the populist discourses of NZF have fluctuated to the point that they are difficult to pin down. In abstract terms, however, NZF’s discourse has been a combination of anti-elitism, anti-neoliberal and anti-globalisation economic stances, cultural nativism, and opposition to immigration. The most important feature that qualifies NZF for inclusion in the dataset is Peters’ relatively consistent anti-elitism (MacDonald 2022, 75). He claims to represent the “relegated, denigrated and forgotten” people of New Zealand against political, business, bureaucratic, and intellectual elites (Gustafson 2006, 62–63; Denemark and Bowler 2002, 51), capturing an “anti-party” sentiment unlike any other party in the country (Bale and Roberts 2002, 12). The following example of Peters’ rhetoric against the incumbent national government in 2017 captures the conspiratorial nature of this claim well:\n\nWe have a government that works only for the elite few – not for you! We have a government that always puts the short-term profits and greed of its cronies ahead of the interests of New Zealanders as a whole. We have a government that serves the globalization agenda of its mates in big corporates and international business (cited in MacDonald 2019, 235–36).\n\nThere is an argument that Peters’ has occasionally toned down his opposition to the political elite while serving in government (MacDonald 2022, 70), but for now we’ve coded him consistently 3 on OTH_POLCLASS.\nThere has been a consistent ethno-centrism to Peters’ discourse. The most complex and debated component of this relates to Maori issues. While Peters and many NZF MPs are of Maori heritage, he has been critical of what he calls the “grievance industry” (MacDonald 2019, 238), and he opposes affirmative action programs that favour indigenous people (Moffitt 2017, 133). This appears not to take a categorical “other” component within his populist language, but rather targets the Maori elite whom he claims has profited at the expense of “regular” Maori (Barker and Vowles 2020, 24). Peters and NZF have also framed their opposition to immigration in ethnic and cultural terms (MacDonald 2019, 236), particularly regarding Asian migrants (Vowles 2020, 46). He has claimed that New Zealand was witnessing a “Chinese invasion” (Gustafson 2006, 64), that domestic enterprises could be taken over by Chinese nationals (Callister 2011, 115), and he has been critical about the social habits of Asian migrants (Gustafson 2006, 64). More recently he has singled out Muslim migrants and asylum seekers, alleging that there was a “militant underbelly” to Islam (Moffitt 2017, 133). According to MacDonald, however, in recent years (especially since becoming foreign minister in 2005) Peters’ has engaged in more “dog whistle” xenophobia than the clear-cut nativism of his earlier statements, and has in more recent times distanced himself from more overtly racist comments made by members of his party (MacDonald 2019, 227, 236). This could be further researched, but we’ve coded Peters 3 on OTH_ETHNIC until 2005 and 2 afterward. We find that OTH_IMMIGRANT should be coded at 3 consistently.\nPeters’ discourse has also targeted the business elite (Barker and Vowles 2020, 21), whom he once accused of “hijacking” the government (Miller 1997, 169). We have not seen quite enough evidence that this reaches beyond 2 on OTH_FINANCIAL. He has also build a general antipathy to foreign entities and interests that threaten the people of New Zealand. In 1996, for example, Peters asked “whose country is it? A country fit for the families of ordinary New Zealanders, whose votes have placed the politicians in power, or a paradise for foreign take-over merchants looking for cheap gains at our expense?” (cited in Gustafson 2006, 63). Given he has not alleged that his domestic rivals are wholly controlled by and loyal to these interests, we’ve kept OTH_FOREIGN at 2.\nNZF is somewhat difficult to define on the left-right scale (see Donovan 2020). Peters original reason for leaving National was his opposition to privatisations and neo-liberal policies, and many scholars have placed the party in the ideological centre (Bale and Roberts 2002, 3; Vowles 2020, 63). However the more salient features of his rhetoric appear to be a kind of soft nationalism (Vowles 1997) and social conservativism (MacDonald 2019, 235). We’ve therefore coded him CR on LRPOSITION, which appears to be in line with most of the literature. The party has been totally reliant on Peters’ personality and “charismatic style” from its inception (Denemark and Bowler 2002, 52; Miller 1997, 172; Levine and Roberts 1994, 242; Joiner 2009), and he has maintained control of its organisation (Mulgan and Aimer 2004, 253) (CHARISMA =3). Peters has had a highly antagonistic relationship with the press throughout his career (Rudd and Connew 2007, 53), but we do not see enough evidence to code above 1 on LIBDEMNORMS (this is backed up by Barker and Vowles 2020, 22). As Peters held a cabinet position in National government before he launched NZP, we have labelled the party 2 on INSIDER from its inception."

    "text": "Not included\nFormer Labour Party president Jim Anderton founded the breakaway NewLabour Party (NLP) in 1989 in reaction to the neo-liberal turn in Labour (specifically the privatisation of assets). NLP drew many members from the Labour Party, although Anderton was its only MP. After the 1990 election, the NLP merged with several other parties (including the Democratic Party, a.k.a. Social Credit) to form The Alliance before the 1993 election, with Anderton as its leader. After initially polling well, the fortunes of the party declined before the 1993 election when Winston Peters (with whom the Alliance had been in discussions about recruiting) started NZF (Jesson 1997, 159). The Alliance went on to form government with Labour after the 1999 election, after which their electoral fortunes declined. Gustafson claims that Anderton himself was “undeniably” a populist (Gustafson 2006), and the Alliance played heavily on the promise that they would not break their promises like the other parties did, even pledging to resign if they did, giving them a “revivalist” and anti-politics appeal in the electorate (Jesson 1997, 162). However we have not seen enough evidence that this quite reaches the threshold of anti-elite hostility necessary to meet our minimum definition, and the party appears to be more of a policy driven soft-protest party rather than a truly populist one. There is a case to be made that Robert Muldoon (National Party PM 1975-84) was a populist (see Gustafson 2006), and some have considered Peters to be the natural successor of Muldoon’s in this regard (Joiner 2009). This could be investigated further, but for now we don’t quite see the evidence for this as it relates to our minimum definition. \nReferences\nAimer, Peter. 1988. ‘The Rise of Neo-Liberalism and Right Wing Protest Parties in Scandinavia and New Zealand: The Progress Parties and the New Zealand Party’.

    "text": "Date range:\nElections included:\nNot included:\nChile suffered a military dictatorship at the hands of General Augusto Pinochet from 1973 until 1990. In 1988 a referendum was held on whether to continue with Pinochet’s dictatorship, which was won by the NO. The first democratic elections were held in 1989 and Patrio Aylwin, a center-left Christian Democrat, became president. Chile has traditionally been considered an exception to the succession of populist leaders in other Latin American countries. As Drake (1999: 72) argues, “populism did not disrupt the transition to democracy or occupy center stage”. “Centrist and leftist politicians did not want populism to upset the new democracy any more than they wanted to disturb macroeconomic equilibrium” (Drake, 1999: 72). Thus, none of the big coalition of Chilean parties is considered populist by most scholars. However, although no populist leader has held the presidency since 1990, there are a number of less successful candidates that should be included in that category."

Before running for president, Errázuriz held no political position (1 in Insider Populism). The movement was a surprise at the time and, not being backed by any party, his campaign was purely based on his personal figure (3 in Personality Dependent).\nErrázuriz appealed an antiparty undercurrent based on “vaguely nationalistic, reformist, anticorruption, antipolitician platform aimed at broad segments of the middle classes and unorganized workers” (Drake, 1999: 73). His platform was based on praising the free-market system and promising social justice (Drake, 1999: 73). He put himself, a wealthy businessman, as an example of an accomplished life and claimed to be able to show Chileans the way to the same wealth and wellbeing (Errázuriz, 1989a). I have labelled 3 for Political Class, and 1 for Foreign Interests and Economical Elite.\nErrázuriz’s discourse, although anti-politician, was conciliatory. He argued against the polarization of society in two blocks: “do not divide the country in two sides… we need unity” (Errázuriz, 1989a) and he claimed that he did not call voters to vote against nobody (Errázuriz, 1989b). Although he has been later involved in several cases of corruption, there is nothing in his 1989 campaign that indicates a violation of LD norms. However, his aim to leave the past behind also means that he did not condemn the military dictatorship, nor it consider it part of the establishment (1 in Military). I have not been able to find any negative reference to either immigrants or Ethnic others."

    "text": "Joaquín Lavín\nThe Independent Democratic Union or (UDI) was founded in 1982 as one of the parties that defended the military dictatorship. The party was “inspired by Spanish Franquismo corporatism” and “its founding leader, Jaime Guzmán, was the political ideologue of the authoritarian regime” (Luna et al. 2013: 923). The UDI “was born in the midst of neo-conservatism, and in the context of a conservative turn within the Catholic Church” (Luna et al. 2013: 929). Moreover, the party “developed close ties with business interests which partially explains its electoral performance since 1989 in the upper sectors of the Chilean society and its financial campaign advantages” (Luna et al. 2013: 924) but also aimed at attracting the poorer sections of society through the financing of specific programs targeted to the poor (Luna, 2010: 326). As a defender of the military establishment and Pinochet’s legacy, the party cannot be considered populist in its first elections. Scholars agree that it is Joaquin Lavin’s leadership which introduces an “anti-politics discourse” in the campaigns (Silva, 2001; Luna, 2010; Luna et al. 2013; Cortés and Pelfini, 2017).\nJoaquin Lavin’s professional evolution follows that of other Chicago boys-technocrats. He studied at Chicago, became dean of School of Economics at a Chilean University, participated in Pinochet’s administration, became secretary general of the UDI from 1990 to 1994 and acted as mayor of a municipality in the 90s. He did not, however, participate in the inner circle of Pinochet’s government (1 for Insider Populism). The UDI was very much attached to Pinochet’s legacy but his arrest in London in 1988 introduced a change in the political discourse of the party, by which the praises to the dictatorship were kept to a minimum (Silva, 2001: 28) and a more moderated image for the party was crafted (Luna, 2010: 346). The crisis and several cases of corruption in the previous government gave way to Lavin’s anti-political and neo-populist strategy “expressed in his abhorrence of politics and political parties, and his inclination to 'technify' social problems and their solutions” (Silva, 2001: 33). He claimed to be concentrating on the real problems of the people by addressing particular issues instead crafting large plans. His is a combination of technocratic and populist rhetoric (Silva, 2001: 33). The party self-proclaimed itself as the “popular party” in order to enhance its identification with the people and it proclaimed to overcome the left-right divide (Cortés and Pelfini, 2017: 67). I have coded 3 for Political Class, 1 for Financial Elite and Foreign Interests, given its strictly orthodox neoliberal commitments and 2 for Personality Dependent since it was Lavin who introduced the novel anti-politics discourse to an already established party. Without him, the party would have continued to exist, but it would not have taken its populist stance.\nNeither immigration nor indigenous communities were a central element in Lavin’s campaign, and he has shown itself to be in favor of a better recognition for the Mapuches (Emol, 2013) and for a regulated open immigration policy. I have not found any indication of Violation of LD norms. In fact, when he lost the election, he stood in the balcony of the winner, Ricardo Lagos, as a way of signaling his commitment to collaborate with the new government in a friendly manner (Silva, 2001: 35). I have coded 1 in these three categories.\nLuna et al. (2013) point out that Lavin’s candidacy implied a disrupture in UDI’s traditional politics. This disrupture did not continue after Lavín’s failed bids for president. In 2009, the leader of the Alliance for Chile, was the candidate from the National Renovation, Sebastián Piñera. In 2013, Evelyn Matthei, a former minister under Piñera’s government and member of UDI, was the candidate of the alliance and again in 2017 Piñera was presented as the candidate for the right-wing coalition. Both have explicitly rejected populist rhetoric (Emol, 2013b; Romainville, 2018) and they are not treated as populist in the scholarship. Moreover, it is not clear until what point the party did change its position to a populist one under Lavín. It is perfectly possible to consider Lavín’s anti-political discourse exclusive of the leader and not of the party. However, considering Lavín’s role as the leader of the party as the leader of the opposition for several years, I have decided to leave the UDI in the dataset for the 2001 and 2005 legislative elections. However, I have not added the party before or after Lavín’s period."

    "text": "Communist Party / Together we can do more for Chile\nThere has been extensive debate over whether Communist and/or Socialist ideologies are similar or dissimilar to populist discourses. Hawkins and Rovira-Kaltwasser (2017) argue that the combination of Marxism and populism is common in Chile, being Salvador Allende its prime example.\nThe Communist Party of Chile is “a revolutionary Party, which fights for socialism and recognizes the driving role of the working class” (Communist Party of Chile, 2002) that aims at the “suppression of all forms of political, economic, social and cultural domination over the people” (Communist Party of Chile, 2002). Although Marxist parties tend to downplay their national ties in favor of internationalism while populist parties are usually more nationalistic, the Chilean Communist Party aims at combining the two by stating that its inspiration is “national, patriotic, Latin Americanist and internationalist” (Communist Party of Chile, 2002). Furthermore, the party is “anti-imperialistic” and “fights for the self-determination of the peoples and is in solidarity with all those who fight for their national independence, for democracy, for socialism and peace.” (Communist Party of Chile, 2002). I have coded 3 for Financial Elite, Foreign Interests and Political Class and “Far-Left” as its ideology.\nAlthough the Communist party is a revolutionary party and “its sustained on the ideas of Marx, Engels and Lenin” (Communist Party of Chile, 2002), it also proclaims that “because of its tradition and democratic spirit, it fights for democracy as a form of political organization of society” and that “its humanistic conception contains the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights” (Communist Party of Chile, 2002). I have not found actions carried out by the Communist Party in this period that imply a violation of LD norms. I have coded this category as a 2.\nThe party suffered persecution during the dictatorship and could not compete in the first elections under its name. Since Allende’s government, the Communist party did not participate in the administration and was not led by any charismatic leader. Therefore, I have coded 3 for Military, and 1 for Insider Populism and Personality Dependent.\nIn 2005, the party forms an electoral alliance with the Humanist party called “Together we can do more for Chile” (“Juntos Podemos Más por Chile”) and presented their leader, Tomás Hirsch, as their candidate for president. There were many ideological similarities between these two parties and the Communist party remained as the largest party in the coalition. Moreover, Hirsh campaigned on a progressive left-wing platform similar to that of the Communist party (Angell and Reig, 2006). Thus, I have kept the same coding as in the previous elections.\nIn 2009, 2013 and 2017 parliamentary elections, the Communist Party became part of the electoral alliance of the “Concertación” and “Nueva Mayoría” but obtained less than 5% of the votes. For the presidential elections, the party presented a candidate, supported Bachelet’s candidacy for 2013 and her successor’s in 2017. Thus, I have not coded the Communist party for these years. In 2009, “Together we can do more for Chile” presented Jorge Arrate as their presidential candidate. He ran on similar ideas to what the party defended before."

His family was forced into exile and when he went back to Chile, he became known as a TV host and as a movie director. He became a member of parliament in 2005 for the Socialist Party. In 2009, the left-wing electoral alliance denied the possibility of holding fair primary elections and instead chose former president Eduardo Frei as their candidate. Enríquez-Ominami decided then to run for the presidency as an independent obtaining the third position in the elections. He ran again in 2013 and in 2017, although less successfully. I have labelled 1 for Insider Populism and 2 for Personality Dependent because the movement grew up from a general social discontent with political parties at the time but his electoral platform was entirely based on his persona.\nThe campaign of MEO was personalist, mediatic, with a strong emotional speech, based on the closeness to the people and facing its other contenders whom it identified as \"figures of the past\" (Dosek and Freidenberg, 2014: 22). He wishes to distance himself from the old political elite, which he considered that had “kidnapped politics and did not offer a change for Chile” (Dosek and Freidenberg, 2014: 23). He denounced that millions of Chileans were “outside of the political process” and campaign to end that situation (Enríquez-Ominami, 2009).\nMEO ran on a left-wing platform, based on promising free public education and an increase of the minimum salary (Manifesto, 2009) but his platform is not radical. He wished to “raise corporate taxes but lower the income tax” and he “also expressed an openness to having the state divest itself of a small stake of its copper Company” (Moffett and Pica, 2009). Thus, his main target is the political class but not the economic elite.\nEnríquez-Ominami has a favorable position towards immigration and indigenous communities in Chile, arguing that “a great deal of the history of Chile is written together with Mapuches and immigrants” (CNN, 2017). I have labelled 1 for Immigration and Ethnic Others. I have not found any reference that could be used to identify the military as an enemy of the people in MEO’s discourse.\nEnríquez-Ominami has proclaimed the need to democratize the country, regenerate politics, “combat social inequality and promoting regional political unity” (Moffett and Pica, 2009). I have labelled 1 in LD norms and 1 in Foreign Interests since he is in favor of deeper regional integration and an open economy."

    "text": "Broad Front\nThe Broad Front (“Frente Amplio”) is a coalition of left-wing parties created in 2017 in order to compete in the elections. Its origins can be traced to the student protests of 2011 and the coalition includes a wide variety of left and far-left parties with the exception of the Communist party, which participated in the centre-left coalition. González Le Saux exposes the Broad Front’s vision of the economic and political system in Chile:\n\n“From Frente Amplio's perspective, the bipartisan logic of compromise between the two ruling coalitions has allowed the neoliberal model-cemented during the country's 17-year dictatorship under Augusto Pinochet (1973-1990)-to continue, with only moderate reforms aimed at mitigating its most draconian consequences. Frente Amplio seeks to overcome a transitional order characterized by a neoliberal economy, export-driven extractivism, and the privatization of social rights in the realms of education, health, labor, and social security” González Le Saux, (2017).\n\nIt is a party that criticises harshly the establishment and wishes a radical rupture with it: “Frente Amplio is appealing to the novelty and integrity of its candidates, unpolluted by the links between money and politics. Against the paternalistic and top down functioning of traditional parties, it promotes a participatory style of politics” (González Le Saux, 2017). The Broad Front, thus, has a “left-wing agenda of anti-neoliberalism, environmentalism, pro-immigrant and LGBTQI rights” (González Le Saux, 2017). I have coded 3 for Political Class, Financial Elite and “Far-left” as ideology.\nThe presidential candidate was Beatriz Sánchez, a radio and TV host that identified herself as “left-wing, but a very democratic left” and who stresses the importance of discussion as a way of reaching agreements (The Global Vote, 2017) (1 in Violation of LD norms). Sánchez never held a position in government and did not belong to any party before 2017 (1 in Insider Populism). Since the party was created independently of Sánchez and would have existed without her, I have coded 1 in Personality Dependent.\nShe declares herself as a feminist candidate for the presidency and is a defender of LGTB rights and abortion (The Global Vote, 2017). Additionally, she is particularly critic with the sharp inequalities in Chile: “The concentration of wealth is one of the highest in Latin America. [The rich should] pay fair taxes. I don’t want them not to earn money, but to pay fair taxes.” (The Global Vote, 2017).\nThe army received harsh criticism from Sanchez due to the lack of governmental control over it (Sanchez, 2016). Moreover, she also argued against the privileges the army has in comparison with other public servants such as a better pension scheme or healthcare system (Sanchez, 2016). The reason for this, she argued, was that “there isn’t a real dominion of the Civil power over the military power” and urged to change that situation (Sanchez, 2016). I have labelled 3 for Military.\nOn Foreign Interests, “the agenda is predominantly domestic, with relatively little reference made to international affairs or Chile’s role in the world” (The Global Vote, 2017). I have not found nationalist rhetoric nor the identification of external threats in Sanchez’s discourse (1 for Foreign Interests)."

    "text": "José Antonio Kast\nJosé Antonio Kast is a lawyer from a prominent political family in Chile. He was a city councillor, a member of the chamber of deputies for 14 years and secretary general of the UDI. Kast was a well-known figure of the most conservative current of the UDI and left the party in 2016 in order to run for president in the 2017 campaign on a more right-wing and populist platform. He has professed many times its admiration for Bolsonaro’s defeat of the “corrupt left” (Tele13, 2018).\nKast is a strong supporter of the dictatorship of Pinochet, saying that if Pinochet were alive, he would vote for him (Freixas, 2019). He participated in the campaign for the YES to the dictatorship in the 1988 referendum and his brother, as one of the “Chicago Boys”, actively participated in Pinochet’s government. Moreover, he asked for the liberation of one of the torturers of the dictatorship (Freixas, 2019). Kast is in favor of increasing military spending, stating that “the armed forces, in justified cases and as a strictly exceptional measure, will be able to collaborate in matters of public security when they are required in order to fight terrorism and drug trafficking. Improvements, innovation and new powers and attributions require a bigger budget. To this end, the limits of the use of the Fund created by the Copper Reserve Law will be revised so that these resources can be used to increase the available military budget” (The Global Vote, 2017). 1 for Military.\nKast is strongly opposed to abortion, feminism and LGBT rights and considers the right-wing president, Sebastían Piñera as a “soft right” for “lack of character” and for giving in to pressures from the opposition” (Freixas, 2019). After the 2017 election, he created a new party called Republican Action and its logo clearly references that of the French Front National. On economic issues, he is committed to neoliberal policies and argues for a small state that is free from “politicking, privileges, duplicities or useless agencies” (Kast, 2017).\nGiven all the above I have coded Far Right as ideology, 3 for Political Class, 3 for Violation of LD norms and 1 for Financial Elite and Military.\nOn the relation between Chile and its neighbors, Kast displays a nationalistic view and identifies physical barriers as the solution to the long-standing territorial dispute with neighboring Bolivia. Kast stated that “we want to reaffirm the autonomy of Chile and its sovereignty that must be exercised in every corner of the country. For a long time, we have been passive spectators of the communication abuses of our neighbors of the northeast and we have not responded with sufficient force and decision to the lies of the Bolivian government… Physical barriers are required on the Chile-Peru and the Chile-Bolivia border to support our police and to help to fight drug trafficking and smuggling at the border. In addition, we need to incorporate more technology for the detection and prosecution of border crimes” (The Global Vote, 2017). 3 for Foreign Interests.\nHe is in favor of controlling migration, commenting that “those people who are going to come must know that as of today, Chile is not ready to receive all people.” (The Global Vote, 2017). “But we must also be rigorous in controlling our borders and in rejecting illegal immigration in every event (The Global Vote, 2017). Additionally, Kast has been criticized for”constructing a hate discourse regarding race, ethnicity or sexual minorities” (Freixas, 2019). I have coded 3 for Immigration and Ethnic Others.\nAlthough Kast did not participate in the government, he was a prominent member of the UDI for many years and secretary general of the party before he decided to run as an independent. I have decided to code him as 2 in Insider Populism. It is plausible to imagine that other far-right parties could have emerged in the 2017 elections, but Kast’s movement was based on his personas as he ran as an independent and then founded the party Republican Action. I believe this deserved a 2 in Personality Dependent.\nReferences\nAngell, A. and Reig, R. (2006) “Change or continuity?

    "text": "Bulgarian Business Bloc\nThe Bulgarian Business Bloc (Bulgarski biznes blok, BBB) was founded to defend business interests in the early 1990s (Kosová 2022, 370). Although not created by him, the party became totally dependent on its 1992 presidential candidate George Ganchev (Lessenski 2020, 45; Zankina 2016, 196; Georgi Karasimeonov 1995, 583), a flamboyant businessman who had lived abroad (CHARISMA = 3). Ganchev placed third in that election with 16.78%, and reached 21.9 in the 1996 presidential election. The BBB won 5.27% of the vote in the 1997 parliamentary election. Ganchev split from the party to form the George Ganchev Bloc for the 2001 parliamentary elections, at which both entities polled poorly.\nGanchev’s campaign was light on programmatic policy, but heavy on criticism of the political class, both sides of which he alleged to be equally corrupt, dishonest and incompetent (Levitt and Kostadinova 2014, 529). In Cristova’s words:\n\nFor the first time, the bifurcation and polarization in political discourse were superseded by an indiscriminate attack on the political elite altogether. His rhetorics witnessed an emergent attack on parliamentary democracy, which was testified in his depiction of deputies as “liars in parliament” (Cristova 2010, 223)\n\nOther literature has labelled him a “protest candidate” (Bastian 1998, 192) and an “opportunist” (Georgi Karasimeonov 1995, 583). On this basis we’ve coded him 3 on (OTH_POLCLASS = 3)\nOther than this anti-politician rhetoric, we cannot see any evidence that the campaigns of Ganchev or BBB should register on the OTH_IMMIGRANT, OTH_ETHNIC, OTH_MILITARY, or OTH_FOREIGN, even though Ganchev was a strident nationalist (Georgi Karasimeonov 1995, 583), and the party was generally right wing (LRPOSITION = R). We’ve also seen no evidence that Ganchev was a participant in previous governments (INSIDER = 1), or that his campaign violated liberal democratic norms (LIBDEMNORMS = 1)."

    "text": "National Movement – Simeon II\nIn 2001, the former King Simeon Saxe-Goburg-Gotha (who served as a child monarch during WWII) ran a reformist campaign that is widely referred to as populist (see for example Raycheva and Peicheva 2020, 76). This was furnished with a new party, the National Movement - Simeon Second / NMSS). Simeon’s campaign was a mixture of royal nostalgia, frustration with the political class, and the promise of an immediate improvement in living conditions (Cristova 2010, 224). It was based exclusively on the charisma of Simeon himself (G Karasimeonov and Lyubenov 2013, 413; Gurov and Zankina 2013, 5) (CHARISMA = 3). Simeon’s OTH_POLCLASS rhetoric was somewhat “softer” (Smilov and Krastev 2008, 9) than other populists in Bulgara, given that he promised to work with rivals transcend the pettiness of the current party system. Nonetheless, his campaign did paint a picture of the elite as enjoying “inexplicable richness” while the people suffered (Cristova 2010, 224), and presented a totally non-ideological and binary representation of the people and the elite (Smilov and Krastev 2008, 16; Gurov and Zankina 2013, 5), justifying at least a 2 on this variable.\nWe have seen no evidence of any other relevant OTH_ variable, and despite his status as a former monarch, he was not any kind of INSIDER when he ran. Simeon’s transcendent image became diluted in office as he acted in increasingly partisan ways, and by the time he ran for re-election he did not present any populist traits at all (Cholova 2012, 78; Van Kessel 2015, 39)."

    "section": "Attack",
    "text": "Attack\nWhile Ganchev had attempted a kind of right wing populism in the early 1990s, the first true far right populist party, Attack (Ataka), emerged in 2005 led by journalist Volen Siderov and based on his cable TV program of the same name. Attack utilised an extreme ethnocentric rhetoric as a rallying cry to disaffected voters, advocating “to take our Bulgaria back for the Bulgarians” (Ghodsee 2008, 30). The country allegedly needed to be taken “back” from a range of enemies, among them ethnic minorities such as Jews, Roma and Turks (Mestan 2022) (OTH_ETHNIC = 3).\nIt also utilised a radical anti-establishment rhetoric (Stoyanov and Kostadinova 2021, 230), claiming to represent the people as a whole (Smilov and Krastev 2008, 17), in opposition to a corrupt and self-serving elite. In Siderov’s maiden parliamentary speech, he claimed that “the Bulgarian people have been aroused and have deafeningly slapped the face of the so-called political class that has long turned into a herd of grunting pigs, into unfeeling balls of lard, deaf to the problems and the suffering of their own people” (Ghodsee 2008, 31). It also utilised an anti-globalist against the influence of the US (which Siderov considered to be controlled by Jews, (Ghodsee 2008, 32)), NATO, the World Bank and the IMF (Cristova 2010, 225), and the EU (OTH_FOREIGN=3). We could not find any specific references to anti-immigrant rhetoric in the years in which Ataka is included in the dataset (OTH_IMMIGRANTS = 1), although this could be investigated further. We’ve coded the party’s OTH_FINANCIAL rhetoric 2 given that it seems to be an extension of OTH_POLCLASS and OTH_FOREIGN rhetoric rather than opposition to businesses and the wealthy per se (Ghodsee 2008).\nThe party was dominated by the personality of Siderov (Ghodsee 2008, 32) (CHARISMA = 3), and given its occasionally violent rhetoric and actions it also deserves a 3 on LIBDEMNORMS. The party’s core left-right ideology is a hotly debated subject. While it presents the nativism and ethnocentrism typical of far-right parties, it also presents a programme critical of neo-liberalism, in particular the privatisation of state assets to political cronies and foreign powers. It has also advocated higher spending on welfare and social programs. Raycheva and Peicheva claim that the party’s ideology is a combination of “extremist right-wing with extreme left-wing ideas” (Raycheva and Peicheva 2020, 75). Given the salience of the party’s ethnonationalism, we’ve coded it FR. Cholova has suggested that the party moderated its image around 2009 in order to drop its pariah status (Cholova 2012, 78), but we cannot see enough evidence for a change on any of these variables. Further research should confirm this."

    "section": "GERB",
    "text": "GERB\nThe strongest populist party since Simeon has been the centre-right GERB (Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria) founded by the popular mayor of Sofia (and former bodyguard) Boyko Borisov. The party is built around Borisov’s crass man-of-the-people appeal in a similar way to Ganchev in the 1990s, with his main criticism being corruption and ties to organised crime in existing governments (Cristova 2010, 225; Cholova 2012, 85). GERB achieved remarkable success in taking the place of the SDS and NMSS as the dominant centre right party from 2009 and as a result Borisov has dominated national politics in various coalitions for the past decade, weathering a storm of protests that saw him temporarily resign in 2013.\nWhile he is generally right wing (LRPOSITION = CR), Borisov’s ideology was kept quite vague (Gurov and Zankina 2013, 6; Smilov 2008, 19). His hostility to the political class is rooted in allegations of corruption and incompetance – alleging for example that Parliament was full of “liars” and losers” (Cristova 2010, 226) – particularly in relation to their inability to tackle organised crime (Cholova 2012, 85). He therefore “portrayed himself as a man of the people fighting against the corrupt elite” (G Karasimeonov and Lyubenov 2013, 415). It is however debatable whether Borisov and GERB deserve a 2 or a 3 in OTH_POLCLASS. There is reason to believe that his anti-politician rhetoric was not as strong as others in Bulgaria at the time – in part due to the fact that Borisov was himself connected to previous governments, and had an interest in eschewing the ‘populist’ label (G Karasimeonov and Lyubenov 2013, 415). While this could be further researched (particularly whether it has changed over time), we’ve labelled it 3 here.\nBorisov is also pro-European, and it is not evident from my reading that OTH_ETHNIC politics is prominent in his populism. Likewise, OTH_FOREIGN rhetoric does not seem to be significant part of his platform, nor is OTH_FINANCIAL given that the party generally promotes a sound business environment in its policies and platforms (Cholova 2012, 87). It is difficult to code the party on OTH_IMMIGRANT. Immigration has not been a salient political topic in Bulgaria until very recently, and much of the criticism GERB receives on the issue seems to have more to do with its choice of far right coalition parties rather then rhetoric emanating from Boyko himself. We’ve kept the coding at 1 in elections since 2014, further research should confirm this.\nThe party was and is entirely built around the down-to-earth tough guy personality of Borisov (Cristova 2010, 226; Smilov 2008, 19) (CHARISMA=3). As opposed to the regal and high-minded Simeon, this was rooted in a common man persona honed by skilled media performances and the personalisation of public policy (Ganev 2018, 99). According to Gurov and Zankina Borisov “shares the popular dislike of institutions and the bureaucracy, labeling entire socio-occupational categories—such as judges or parliamentary deputies—inefficient and corrupt,” and rarely complies with constitutional constraints on his executive power (Gurov and Zankina 2013, 9). The government has also pressured state TV to supress voices critical of GERB (Ganev 2018, 96). However, it is not clear from research that this hostility to democratic institutions constitutes a wholesale threat to democracy on the scale of Attack (LIBDEMNORMS = 2). Given that Borisov was the head of the police under Simeon II (Smilov 2008, 19), We have coded him 2 for INSIDER in his first election in 2009 and 3 in all others after forming government."

    "text": "Patriotic Front/ United Patriots\nTwo far-right parties smaller than Ataka, the National Front for the Salvation of Bulgaria (NFSB) and IMRO Bulgarian National Movement (IMRO-BNM), formed a coalition for the 2014 elections called “Patriotic Front” (PF). NFSB is led by Valeri Simeonov, a media mogul who was once closely aligned with Attack’s leader Siderov before the two fell out bitterly (Simeonov is the owner of the SKAT cable TV station that Siderov’s original “Attack” program aired on). The IMRO has a more independent history, and could be considered somewhat more moderate than Attack, although not to the point of changing any of its coding here. The coalition received 7.28% in 2014, and was organised around a program highly similar to Attack’s. After seeing its own vote decline in comparison to the PF, Attack decided to join the group (previously bitter rivals) for the 2017 elections under the name United Patriots (UP), winning 15%.\nWhile there are some differences between the three parties in this coalition, we have not seen any evidence to code PF or UP any differently to Attack, except for on the OTH_IMMIGRANT variable. This is not due to outlook as much as context: immigration was not a salient political issue in Bulgaria until the Syrian refugee crisis made it so (Weisskircher and Rone 2016, 2).\nReferences\nBastian, Jens. 1998. ‘From Former to Post: Communist Parties in Central and Eastern Europe’.

The legacy of nationalist politics has meant that there is little space for a far-right populist movement. O’Malley and FitzGibbon (O’Malley and FitzGibbon 2015) argue that populism has an ‘everywhere and nowhere’ presence in Irish politics, in that the general tropes of rural people being forgotten by the establishment is almost ubiquitous in political rhetoric. This is most often said of the long-time dominant party Fianna Fáil (Garner 2007, 109; Suiter 2016, 127) (although less so from the 2000s on). Despite this, there is not sufficient reason to treat that party as populist by our standards – further research should confirm this."

    "section": "The Workers’ Party",
    "text": "The Workers’ Party\nIn the late 1960s Sinn Fein and the IRA split into two groups: the “official” group under the incumbent leadership and the “provisional” breakaway faction. The official leadership wanted to remake republicanism into a more Marxist-aligned and anti-militarism grouping, whereas the provisionals wanted to continue armed struggle (so-called “physical force” republicanism) against the British presence in the North. Over time the provisionals became known as simply “Sinn Fein” and the officials adopted the “Workers’ Party” (WP) by 1982. The party gradually improved its performance through the 1980s to peak at 5% in 1989, after which it split into a number of other left-wing movements.\nInformation on the WP is hard to come by, but evidence suggests that it should be included in this dataset for its general anti-establishment stance and its advocacy of anti-system politics. This included refusing to participate in coalition governments (Abedi 2004, 53) (OTH_POLCLASS = 3). According to Dunphy & Hopkins, (Dunphy and Hopkins 1992, 105), it benefited from a general protest vote against the more established parties in the 1980s, particularly in the poorer areas of Dublin. As a left-wing party, it should be inferred that it maintained a strong OTH_FINANCIAL opposition, although it should be noted that I’ve not found explicit articulations of this populism in research to-date.\nWP initially maintained the republican tradition’s anti-foreign influence politics, accusing its rivals of being in the service of “Anglo-American imperialism in all its exploitative forms” (Dunphy and Hopkins 1992, 95). However over the years it reduced this pillar of its politics in accordance with its shift toward a more domestic class politics (Dunphy and Hopkins 1992, 97) (OTH_FOREIGN = 2), marking a significant difference from the “provisional” Sinn Fein. The also party differed from the provisional Sinn Fein in the force of its anti-sectarian form of republicanism (Dunphy and Hopkins 1992, 94) (OTH_ETHNIC = 1).\nWhile the ideology of the party was strongly far-left since its foundation, during the 1989 election it was led by the far more moderate Proinsias de Rossa, who expressed more centrist views on market-based economics. While there may be an argument that this should bring the party’s LRPOSITION coding towards the centre, I’ve left it at FL for now given its Marxist ideological legacy since its foundation. Even though the party tried to demilitarise its political movement (the bone of contention between it and the provisionals), it nonetheless maintained as association with a paramilitary (the official IRA) for years after the split (Dunphy and Hopkins 1992, 94, 96), and should therefore be coded as no lower than 2 on LIBDEMNORMS. There is no reason for the party to rise above a 1 on the CHARISMA or INSIDER variables."

    "text": "Sinn Féin\nSinn Fein has been the face of the radical republican movement since its foundation in 1905 – although the party has undergone a number of reformations since then. It is difficult to categorise, and doesn’t fit well into various party ‘families’ in the rest of Europe. Given its association with militant republicanism – historically against the post-Treaty government of the republic and in favour of reunification with Northern Ireland – it has generally been the placeholder of radical nationalist politics in Ireland. Yet it identifies as left wing, and campaigns on many progressive platforms, making it stand out from other ‘radical nationalist’ parties in Europe (McDonnell 2008, 212). The party was a political outlier for many decades, before emerging in greater numbers in recent elections – arguably since its more moderately nationalist rival Fianna Fail was associated with the post-2008 economic crisis and the resulting controversial austerity measures (Walsh and O’Malley 2012, 15), and since its acceptance of the 1997 Good Friday peace agreement moderated its image. The party’s fortunes improved dramatically in the 2020 elections, where it surged to 24% under new leader Mary Lou McDonald.\nThe most important reason for its inclusion here is its strong current of anti-establishment politics dating back to the party’s original militant opposition to the treaty which established the Republic of Ireland in 1922. SF regarded the parties who supported it (including many of its own former members and factions) as sell outs to the nationalist cause. For many decades the party refused to stand in legislative elections for this reason, and recognised the pre-1922 Dáil Éireann (revolutionary parliament) as the legitimate legislature. The party slowly withdrew form this position to stand in national elections, but the legacy of the hostility to the pro-treaty political class lives on in the party. In several other aspects of policy (crime policy and anti-drugs policy for example) it has expressed a general distrust of the state, and campaigns against the established parties in a generally populist manner (Fitzgibbon and Guerra 2010, 280; McDonnell 2008, 212; Walsh and O’Malley 2012, 7; Maillot 2005, 5). In the words of O’Malley and Fitzgibbon, SF “frequently juxtaposes itself with the mainstream parties, Fianna Fáil and Labour, and promotes itself as the only uncorrupted political representatives of the Irish people” (O’Malley and FitzGibbon 2015, 284; see also Coakley 2021). In recent elections it has considered the two main parties as a single entity engaged in a “phoney war” against each other (Park and Suiter 2021, 126). Under the leadership of Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness the party has pursued a more ‘political’ strategy of abandoning formal ties with militants (especially the Irish Republican Army, of which many see SF as the political wing) which has arguably led to a decline in its radical anti-political class credentials. Nonetheless, the party still seems to deserve a 3 on OTH_POLCLASS by our standards. Under the leadership of McDonald, SF2 202 campaign has also been seen as highly “anti-elite” and populist (Park and Suiter 2021, 126; Little 2020, 716).\nSinn Fein’s nationalism is build primarily around an opposition to foreign intervention, especially from the UK, and to a lesser degree from the EU, which it generally opposes (McDonnell 2008, 212; Suiter 2016, 131). The party’s designation of the UK as an enemy of the Irish people dates back to its revolutionary foundations. Its Euroscepticism has fluctuated over the years, but at times culminated in denunciations of the “euro-elite” in Brussels and their bailout policies (O’Malley and FitzGibbon 2015, 288; Fitzgibbon and Guerra 2010, see also), and after the financial crisis it accused the Irish elite of giving in too easily to easily to EU policies (ibid). This too has probably declined from a peak in the Troubles (c.1969-97) after the signing of the Good Friday Agreement (which the party supported). Nonetheless, the history and culture of anti-colonial nationalism in the party earn it 3 on OTH_FOREIGN.\nWhile elements like nationalism strike a chord with the European radical right, several aspects of its politics differ significantly from others in this family. First the party is economically left-wing, advocating a strong welfare state and protectionist policies to restrict the impact of economic globalisation (O’Malley 2008, 969; Field 2020, 622; Müller and Regan 2021, 550) (LRPOSITION = L). The party’s nationalism is also manifest in its anti-globalisation politics. It opposes the Irish government’s over reliance on foreign direct investment and instead advocates state support for indigenous businesses (Walsh and O’Malley 2012, 7). In line with its leftist economic ideology and populist rhetoric, the party has frequently juxtaposed the Irish people with the financial elite, especially after the financial crisis. It’s 2014 EU manifesto accused mainstream parties of putting “the needs of the banks ahead of the needs of the people” (O’Malley and FitzGibbon 2015, 290). This strain of its politics is somewhat vague (Doyle 2005, 5), and while worth registering does not quite reach a 3 on OTH_FINANCIAL (= 2).\nSecond, the party has a strong history of advocating minorities’ rights and is not anti-immigrant in any way (O’Malley 2008; Doyle 2005, 3) (OTH_IMMIGRANT = 1). The party campaigned ‘no’ on the 2004 referendum on repealing citizenship rights for the children of migrants, and has a long association with anti-racist causes and movements (Doyle 2005, 3). There are many reasons for this, but one of which may be the party’s long established advocacy for the rights of Irish migrants in other countries, particularly the UK (O’Malley 2008, 974; O’Malley and FitzGibbon 2015, 283).\nThe party’s ethnocentrism is also difficult to pin down. Given its firm advocacy for a united Ireland, it would seem to be somewhat majoritarian on the Irish cultural (namely Catholic) identity, to which Ulster Protestants are an important ‘other’. This is in accordance with its general anti-British attitudes. While it has renounced violence since the Good Friday Agreement, the party does have a legacy of supporting sectarian conflict in the Troubles (Walsh and O’Malley 2012, 7) which makes it controversial to this day. Despite that, given its significant focus on social issues and its repeated opposition to sectarianism, and explicit endorsement of ethnic pluralism (McDonnell 2008, 212), SF does not deserve a 3 on OTH_ETHNIC, and hence I have put it at 2 here. There may even be an argument that it deserves a 1 on this scale, which should be the subject of further investigation.\nIt is also somewhat authoritarian, not only due to its history of advocating violent struggle (it is generally regarded as the political wing of the Irish Republican Army) but also due to allegations that Adams’ leadership has relied on violence to quell internal dissent (Walsh and O’Malley 2012, 13) and various other acts of violence committed by the IRA (Fitzgibbon and Guerra 2010, 280). There would have been a time when the party deserved a 3 on the LIBDEMNORMS scale, but post-1998 (Good Friday Agreement) period it would be a stretch to categorise it as a threat to democratic governance (Doyle 2005, 10), hence they receive a 2 on this scale. The party has a long history and an robust organisation, but in recent decades has become strongly associated with the leadership of Gerry Adams (Walsh and O’Malley 2012, 13; Maillot 2005, 98), who seems to have had a very strong personal control over its strategy and identity during the later years of his leadership (see McDonnell 2008, 212 for a discussion of this point). Adams stepped down as leader in 2018 and was replaced by Mary Lou McDonald. We’ve therefore coded SF 2 on CHARISMA until 2018 and 1 in 2020. The party has never been in government (INSIDER = 1) (it has been in a power sharing government in Northern Ireland, but this should not count in this Republic of Ireland election)."

    "text": "Peter Casey\nPeter Casey is a businessperson and media personality who ran for president in 2018. Coming from relative obscurity, he finished in second place behind incumbent Michael Higgins with 23%. We’ve not found very much information about Casey, but he appears to be universally regarded as a right-wing populist (Field 2020, 619). The best information about his campaign narrative comes from Duggan, who characterises Casey as a maverick and outspoken negative campaigner against Higgins (Duggan 2019, 307). His campaign against Higgins included numerous allegations of corruption – for example that the president used €10,000 of taxpayers money on dog-grooming bills (Duggan 2019, 309). More information would be good to bolster this, but coupled with his “outsider” independence it appears to fit a pattern OTH_POLCLASS campaigning (= 3).\nThe other issue for which Casey made headlines was his allegation that the Irish traveller community were not a true ethnic minority and were instead “basically people camping in someone else’s land” (Duggan 2019, 310; Murphy 2021, 14). In the context of Irish society this is essentially OTH_ETHNIC rhetoric, and hence we’ve coded Casey as 2 on this variable. Given Casey’s pro-business background it’s safe to assume that he did not campaign on OTH_FINANCIAL discourse, and we’ve not seen any information regarding his rhetoric on OTH_IMMIGRANTS, OTH_FOREIGN or OTH_MILITARY, and hence he is coded 1 for all. We’ve coded him R in LRPOSITION in line with the literature (Field 2020, 619), and 3 on CHARISMA given his lack of party and “headline grabbing” campaigning style (Duggan 2019, 307). We’ve seen no evidence to code him above 1 on LIBDEMNORMS, and he was never part of a government before his campaign (INSIDER = 1).\nReferences\nAbedi, Amir. 2004.

    "text": "Stanisław Tymiński, a Polish-Canadian businessman, ran an unlikely presidential campaign in 1990 with his newly founded “Party X”. Although he started with very little name recognition, he surprised all observers by coming second in the first ballot (23.1%), although he only increased this to 25.75% in the second where he was roundly defeated by Solidarity’s Lech Wełeşa. Party X did not do well in following year’s legislative elections (0.5%), and Tymiński did not play an important role in Polish politics afterward.\nTymiński’s campaign consisted of a personality centric diatribe against the political class – including both the post-communist and Solidarity factions – calling himself a “third force” that was neither left nor right wing (de Lange & Guerra, 2009:535; Stanley & Cześnik, 2019:70; Jasiewicz, 2008:22; Kucharczyk & Wysocka, 2008:80; Bartkowski, 1991:80) (OTH_POLCLASS = 3). For this his 1990 campaign is universally considered “populist” (see: Pankowski, 2010:66; Surazska & Bivand, 1997:76; Millard, 1994:54; van Kessel, 2015:124). While his policy proposals were light, his “entrepreneurial populism” (Kasprowicz & Hess, 2017:204) was built on the idea that as a successful business man he could create wealth for the people (Sanford, 2002:178; Schöpflin, 1991:239), generally catering to those who felt that they had lost out in the transition to a market system under Solidarity (Surazska & Bivand, 1997:76; Bell, 1997:1268; Sanford, 2002:178). This makes him difficult to code on LRPOSITION, but I’ve called him C.\nNot a lot is written about his platform, but Rok (1992) claims that Tymiński was anti-semitic, and other sources claim that party supporters exhibited high levels of xenophobia (Jasiewicz, 2008:22). While there is not a lot of evidedence to corroborate this, I’ve coded him 2 on OTH_ETHNIC. I’ve seen no evidence for anything registering on the OTH_IMMIGRANT (= 1). According to Bartkowski (1991), which is one of the richest sources available, anti-western sentiment was cornerstone of Tymiński’s appeal. He accused the west of economically colonising Poland via privatisations, and claimed that the political elite were willing to sell the country out to foreign economic interests (Bartkowski, 1991:77). This does not appear in any other observed source, but given the depth of this analysis OTH_FOREIGN is coded 3. As a “self-made” millionaire, he did not present any hostility to the rich (Schöpflin, 1991:248) (OTH_FINANCIAL = 1) The party was based totally on Tymiński’s persuasive (Jasiewicz, 2008:22) and “eccentric” (Bell, 1997:1270) persona (Schöpflin, 1991:239) (CHARISMA = 3). Tyminski had no affiliation with the political class, and no established party organisation (Bell, 1997:1267) (INSIDER = 1). I’ve seen no evidence that he violated LIBDEMNORMS (= 1)."

    "text": "League of Polish Families\nThe League of Polish Families (Liga Polskich Rodzin, LPR), founded in 2001, was a clerical social conservative party that was puritanically anti-EU and opposed to foreign influences in “traditional” Polish (Catholic) culture. The party was the product of conservative Father and media figure Tadeusz Rydzyk, who cobbled together various right wing and Catholic parties in existence at the time (Pankowski, 2010:111). After two strong performances in 2001 and 2005 (7.9% and 8% respectively), the party joined a coalition government with Civic Platform and Order and Justice, after which it was seen by supporters to compromise too much on its program and receded by the early 2007 elections. Most of its voters turned to PiS (Zuba, 2017:91).\nAnti-establishment rhetoric was an important pillar of LPR’s discourse (de Lange & Guerra, 2009:539; Zuba, 2017:100), as it frequently accused the political class of conspiring with foreigners to subvert Polish values and interests. Several scholars point out that the party’s anti-establishment rhetoric was not as extreme as other populists at the time (notably Self Defence) (Markowski & Tucker, 2010:526), but from the available evidence this should still be coded as 3 in the OTH_POLCLASS variable. The party had a generally ethnocentric outlook on the nation (Jasiewicz, 2008:15; Moroska & Zuba, 2010:131), and according to de Lange & Guerra, (2009:538) it “vehemently opposes” non-Catholic “others”, and “openly attacks the roles that Jews” have in society. Members of affiliated youth movements (MW, see below) also promoted explicitly anti-Semitic doctrines (Pankowski, 2010:116). For this I have coded the party 3 on OTH_ETHNIC. Immigration was not high enough during LPR’s time in parliament to register in its populism (Moroska & Zuba, 2010:131). That said, de Lange & Guerra, (2009:539) record that a number of LPR politicians made statements against immigration on cultural grounds. I’ve left OTH_IMMIGRANT at 1 for now, but there is a case to be made that it should be 2.\nOpposition to European integration was the definitive policy of the party (Moroska & Zuba, 2010:130; Jasiewicz, 2008:15; de Lange & Guerra, 2009:537; Markowski & Tucker, 2010), as it considered European liberal values to be antithetical to conservative Polish ones (Jasiewicz, 2008:11). Polish politicians sympathetic to EU integration were accused of “anti-Polish” politics (Moroska & Zuba, 2010:131). Numerous members also made statements alleging that Germans and Jews were the principle beneficiaries of the EU’s schemes (Jasiewicz, 2008:15).This tied in with its generally nationalist outlook that frequently alleged that foreign interests of conspiring against Polish ones (Pankowski, 2010:113) (OTH_FOREIGN = 3). The party opposed foreign investment in Poland (de Lange & Guerra, 2009:539), but in more of a nationalist than an economic sense. Giertych did however accuse Poland’s new business elite of conspiring with foreign interests and former communist officials (Pankowski, 2010:113), and for this reason I’ve coded it 2 on OTH_FINANCIAL.\nWhile there is an argument that the party shifted somewhat in its 7 years in Parliament, based on the above policies I have labelled the party FR on LRPOSITION, and it is usually considered so by scholars (Wysocka, 2013:295; Pankowski, 2010:113; Markowski & Tucker, 2010:526). Father Tadeusz Rydyk, owner of a media empire that included the influential Radio Maryja, was a charismatic influence in founding and endorsing the party (Zuba, 2017:90; Moroska & Zuba, 2010:127; Pankowski, 2010:111; Jasiewicz, 2008:15; Stanley & Cześnik, 2019:72). While he was never actually leader, I’ve coded it 2 on CHARISMA for the 2001 elections given his direct relationship to the meaning of the party. Subsequently, the young Roman Giertych took over and established himself as a charismatic leader (Millard, 2006:1017; Kucharczyk & Wysocka: 2008:78) (especially via a committee post that empowered him to investigate corruption, see: Pankowski, 2010: 112-13), albeit of a party with a strong base. Therefore I’ve kept the CHARISMA coding at 2 for the 2005 and 2007 elections.\nThe party had direct links with the All-Polish Youth (Młodzież Wszechpolska, MW) (Kucharczyk & Wysocka: 2008:78), a radical and violent nationalist street movement whose members “came to dominate the wider party organisation” (Pankowski, 2010:112, 116). MW members intimidated opponents or the LPR and targeted LGBT, feminist and Jewish organisations in particular (Pankowski, 2010:113-16). For this reason I have coded it 3 for LIBDEMNORMS. The party and its leaders had not participated in government before joining in coalition with PiS following the 2005 election (Millard, 2009:791), after which (2007 election) I have coded it 2 on INSIDER."

    "text": "Self Defence\nSelf Defence (Samoobrona Rzeczpospolitej Polskiej, SRP) was long an agrarian trade union before it became a political party, even though it sent candidates to run for office from the 1990s. Appealing to the rural “losers” of the post-communist transition, it was seen by many to espouse a nostalgia for the former regime, albeit with some nationalist ideas (Pankowski, 2010:132). It achieved a breakthrough performance of 10.2% in 2001, and Lepper polled 15.1% in the 2005 presidential election before the party receded to 1.5% in 2007. It briefly served in coalition government with PiS and LPR between 2005 and 2007. The party was totally dominated by its founder-leader Andrzej Lepper, and the inconsistency of many of its (his) positions makes it very difficult to code.\nOne aspect of the SRP that was not at all ambiguous was that it was “anti-establishment by nature” (Moroska & Zuba, 2010:132). Lepper self-identified as “populist” campaigning for the ordinary citizen against the “self-proclaimed new elites” (Jasiewicz, 2008:13; see also van Kessel, 2015:125), thus tapping into a growing cynicism of the political class among voters (Szczerbiak, 2007:212) (OTH_POLCLASS = 3). It also often espoused xenophobia, especially towards Germans (Moroska & Zuba, 2010:130) and Jews, who Lepper has called “the most dangerous nation for Poland” (Pankowski, 2010:139). While there is a case to be made that the ambiguity, inconsistency, and unpredictability of these positions should dampen their place in the party’s core outlook, I’ve labelled SRP 3 on OTH_ETHNIC. I’ve seen no evidence that the party was concerned with OTH_IMMIGRANTS (= 1), although this may be wrong.\nIn its more nationalist tones, the party alleged that foreign interests interfered with the Polish economy. It was occasionally opposed to EU integration, arguing that it would harm the wellbeing of ordinary farmers and enrich a small elite (Jasiewicz, 2008:11; Stanley & Cześnik, 2019:71). For this the party earns a 2 on OTH_FOREIGN (there is a case to be made that this should be 3). Moroska & Zuba, (2010:133) claim that the party stood against foreign capital and capitalists, and much of its early political activities were aimed at opposing debt collectors and high interest charging banks repossessing farms (Pankowski, 2010:133; Markowski & Tucker, 2010:527). (OTH_FINANCIAL = 3).\nThe party’s ideology was ambiguous and erratic (Pankowski, 2010:135) – even to the point that some have called it non-ideological. This was in part due to the fact that Lepper’s charismatic leadership was essence of its political meaning (Jasiewicz, 2008:14; Pankowski, 2010:142) (CHARISMA = 3). In the words of Moroska & Zuba, (2010:129), “Andrzej Lepper consequently became not only the person who expressed his party’s position, but also a spontaneous creator of that position.” While the party has occasionally been considered left wing (Jasiewicz, 2008:11; de Lange & Guerra, 2009:537; Markowski & Tucker, 2010:527; see also Pankowski, 2010:135), the preponderance of evidence suggests that it espoused no actual ideology other than a vague championing of the rural poor (Moroska & Zuba, 2010:130, 132), and Lepper himself seemed to stress different ideological labels at different time, and at other suggested that it was neither left, right or centre, but just “patriotic” (Pankowski, 2010:136). I’ve therefore coded its LRPOSITION at C.\nAs a social movement, Self Defense often held rallies that were accused of violence and lawlessness (Pankowski, 2010:132-3; Markowski & Tucker, 2010:527), and when in Parliament Lepper often brought in PA speakers to drown out the other members when he wanted to drown out other members (Jasiewicz, 2008:13). According to Pankowski (2010), this image of anti-system lawlessness was a key part of the party’s image and appeal (LIBDEMNORMS = 3). The party was never in government before joining a coalition in 2005, after which (2007) it is coded 2 on INSIDER."

    "text": "Law and Justice\nLaw and Justice (Prawo i Sprawiedliwość, PiS) is the party of brothers Jarosław and (the late) Lech Kaczyński, two senior members of the Solidarity movement that took a particularly hard line on the role of ex-communists in the new regime in the 1990s. The brothers initially created the Centre Agreement party in the early 1990s, but without a populist stance nor significant electoral success. After Lech’s stint as Minister of Justice in the centre right Buzek government in which he became popular for fighting corruption (Millard, 2009:790-91), the brothers founded PiS in 2001, gaining 9.5% in that election. In 2005 Lech Kaczyński won the presidency and the party entered minority “populist coalition” government with the LPR and SRP, which collapsed in 2007. While its coalition partners faded in that vote, PiS saw its popularity rise (essentially swallowing the supporters of its two coalition partners), only more so after the death of Lech in a plane crash in Russia in 2010. PiS formed government outright in 2015, when it also retook the presidency. In many of the OTH_ variables, PiS is noted to have made a steady shift away from the centre towards radicalism, particularly by the time of its 2005 and 2007 elections (Jasiewicz, 2008:23; Markowski & Tucker, 2010:528; Pankowski, 2010; Vermeersch, 2007), which makes its early elections (2001 in particular) slightly difficult to code.\nThe party advocated a “fourth republic” that would rid the polity of the corrupt leadership which characterised the third republic (as the post 1989 state had been known) (Jasiewicz, 2008:9; Wysocka, 2013:303; Kucharczyk & Wysocka: 2008:79; see also Markovski, 2008:1056). It targeted what it called the uklad (“network” or “pact”) of elites – ex-communist officials, corrupt post-solidarity politicians, and foreign influences – whom it alleged ran the state: “The network has taken everything for itself. That explains why, after 1989, the people have not had a chance” (cited in Wysocka, 2013:303). There are several scholars who think that PiS only really adopted anti-political class populism by 2005 (van Kessel, 2015:121) or that it was radicalised by 2007 (Jasiewicz, 2008:23; Markowski & Tucker, 2010:528). Stanley & Cześnik (2019:73) persuasively argue that the party was hostile to corruption in 2001, but not nearly as radical as the LPR and SRP (see also Pankowski, 2010:153). Therefore I’ve coded it 2 on OTH_POLCLASS in 2001, and 3 from 2005 on. There is some suggestion that PiS had a more moderate and less confrontation stance in the 2010 presidential election (Szczerbiak, 2013:485), but not enough evidence to justify changing the coding.\nThe PiS clearly considered the “people” in ethnic and sectarian (Catholic) terms, especially after it inherited the nationalist far-right mantle of the LPR by 2007 and the support of the fundamentalist Radio Maryja with it (Pankowski and Kornak, 2013:162). Over time Jarosław Kaczyński made statements to the effect that he had been mistaken to oppose anti-semitism in the past (Pankowski, 2010:155), and the party included some known anti-semitic politicians in its ranks (Pankowski, 2010:157). There was also an infamous incident in which the party and its campaign managers accused Lech Kaczyński’s 2005 presidential rival Donald Tusk of being too German because his grandfather allegedly fought briefly with the Wehrmacht. His grandfather was actually from the Kashuba ethnic minority which had been forcibly conscripted by the Nazis. According to Pankowski (2010:157), this triggered ethnocentric anti-German and anti-Kashuba hostility as much as nationalist disloyalty. Amid the EU refugee crisis in 2015, PiS honed a sharply anti-Islam discourse, alleging that Muslims posed a threat to Polish society, and alleging that they had taken over neighbourhoods and churches in Western Europe (Krzyżanowska & Krzyżanowski, 2018:615; Krzyżanowski, 2018). Like other variables, it is difficult to pin down precisely when this rhetoric began and what level it achieved. I’ve coded OTH_ETHNIC 1 in 2001, 2 2005-2011 and 3 from 2015 on (when anti-Muslim sentiment started to dominate). By 2015, the European Migrant crisis led the PiS to adopt a harsh xenophobic line on asylum seekers (Krzyżanowska & Krzyżanowski, 2018:615; Krzyżanowski, 2018), and in doing so won over many voters “who normally never would have voted for it” (Fomina & Kucharczyk, 2016:62). Before 2015 immigration was not a major topic of political discourse (Krzyżanowski, 2018:76) (OTH_IMMIGRANT = 1 2001-2011, 3 2015-).\nA number of foreign powers are highly relevant to the PiS’s populist nationalism. Hostility toward Germany (historically a rich vein for the Polish right) was a key pillar of PiS’s politics (Wysocka, 2013:305; Szczerbiak, 2013:489), and after the 2010 crash that killed Lech the party propagated a number of conspiracy theories that alleged a Russian assassination (Stanley & Cześnik, 2019:75; Szczerbiak, 2013:486) The party has also over time become thoroughly hostile to the EU, which it accuses of imposing socially liberal values on Poland – although this only developed around 2005-07 (Markowski & Tucker, 2010:528). According to Pankowski, (2010:157-58), each of these oppositions were significantly milder in the 2001 election (OTH_FOREIGN = 2 in 2001, 3 from 2005). While a pro-welfare class politics has often been a pillar of the Kaczyñskis politics (Szczerbiak, 2007:218; Pankowski, 2010:163), this does not appear to rise above 1 on the OTH_FINANCIAL variable (= 1).\nWhile PiS always advocated for a pro-welfare policy of state intervention in the economy (Millard, 2006:1021; Kucharczyk & Wysocka: 2008:79; Szczerbiak, 2007:211), it has always been considered a party of the post-solidarity right, whose anti-communism makes it incompatible with any left wing branding. According to a number of observers (Wysocka, 2013:293; Pankowski, 2010:152) the party started off as centre right in the early 2000s, before embracing a more right wing agenda in subsequent elections. Owing to the above traits of ethnocentrism and nationalism, the party should clearly be defined as far right today (Kasprowicz & Hess, 2017:204). While it is debatable exactly when this shift should take place, I’ve coded its LRPOSITION CR in 2001, R in 2005, and FR from 2007, as this election is when it is usually considered to have taken LPRs place on the far right (Jasiewicz, 2008:11).\nThe party has been defined by the personalities of the Kaczyñski twins (Jasiewicz, 2008:12; Wysocka, 2013:306) who also control it organisation totally (Pankowski, 2010:164), although according to Fomina & Kucharczyk, (2016:60) the party pulled Jarosław “out of public view” for the 2015 elections. It is also worth noting that other leaders have served as Prime minister and President in its recent terms in government. Furthermore, according to some, the brothers are not actually particularly charismatic, even if they are well known. This makes the party difficult to code on CHARISMA – I’ve coded it 2, but this could possibly be 3. The brothers had actually been intimately involved with the highest levels of post-1989 politics (Jasiewicz, 2008:11; Pankowski, 2010:151), making PiS a 2 on INSIDER up to YEAR, when it formed government and is thenceforth coded 3.\nThe PiS has, from its inception until its time in government, projected a majoritirian authoritarianism that threatens liberal democratic norms (Fomina & Kucharczyk, 2016; Pankowski & Kornak, 2013:162). In its early manifestos, PiS made it clear that it wanted to expand the powers of the presidency (Millard, 2006:1017) and reduce those of the legislature and courts (Jasiewicz, 2008:13). It also proposed in 2003 to rewrite the constitution as an explicitly Catholic document – beginning its draft with the words “In the name of God Alighty!” and removing all references to religious and ethnic minorities (Pankowski, 2010:154). In government it has been particularly hostile to the judicial system and media scrutiny (Wysocka, 2013:306, 309) when these have been critical of the party’s interests. According to Pankowski, (2010:151), in the 2001 elections the PiS “did not challenge the basic elements of the Polish democratic system”, and hence I’ve coded it 2 on LIBDEMNORMS in that election and 3 ever since."

    "text": "Palikot’s Movement\nPalikot’s Movement (Ruch Palikota, RP), was a short-lived left wing party best known for its anti-clerical stance. It was a vehicle for the flamboyant and controversial businessman Janusz Palikot, who broke from the Civic Platform in 2010 after accusing its leadership of veering too far to the right. On top of its anti-clericalism, the party advocated a number of left wing stances, such as drug liberalisation, legalised abortion, and LGBT rights (Szczerbiak, 2013:489). The party performed surprisingly well with 10.02%in the 2011 election, but after significant internal divisions waned into insignificance by the 2015 polls, by which time it was a member of a left coalition that could not be considered populist.\nPalikot’s populism targeted the power of the Church in Polish politics: “The Church is not so holy. It is a greedy political party that tries at any cost to keep a firm hand on its own interests” (cited in Zuba, 2017:92). Within this construction, he accused the political class of dependence on the Church (Zuba, 2017:100; see also Fomina & Kucharczyk, 2016:61), and maintained a generally anti-establishment character (Szczerbiak, 2013:489; van Kessel, 2015:130) – even to the point of saying that he and his nemesis Jarosław Kaczyński were alike in their “being against the system” (Wróbel, 2011:450). In the party’s own anti-political class words: ‘[w]e are not the next configuration of the same old elite . . . AWS, PiS, PO, ZChN, PC, KPN, ROP, and now PJN – different names, but the same people’ (cited in Stanley & Cześnik, 2011:706) (OTH_POLCLASS = 3).\nPalikot ran a very business-friendly campaign promising liberal small government (Szczerbiak, 2013:489) (OTH_FINANCIAL = 1), and while the party is usually considered left wing (Zuba, 2017; Szczerbiak, 2013; Sokołowski, 2012), this has much more to do with social policy than economic policy – which by all accounts was a more important pillar of the party’s image (Stanley & Cześnik, 2011:707) (LRPOSITION = L). There is no evidence for anything on the OTH_ETHNIC, OTH_IMMIGRANT, or OTH_FOREIGN variables, which are all coded 1. As its name suggests it was totally dominated by its leader (Zuba, 2017:92; Kosowska-Gąstoł & Sobolewska-Myślik, 2019:14) (CHARISMA = 3), and there is no evidence that it violated LIBDEMNORMS (= 1). Despite being a well-known deputy in the PO government until 2010, Palikot wasn’t really powerful or established enough to be an INSIDER (= 1) (Kosowska-Gąstoł & Sobolewska-Myślik, 2019:15)."

    "text": "Kukiz’15\nThe Association for a New Constitution Kukiz’15 (Stowarzyszenienarzecz Nowej Konstytucji Kukiz’15, Kukiz’15), was the creation of rock singer Paweł Kukiz, who gradually became active in politics in the 2000s-2010s. Originally affiliated with the Civic Platform, his main concern grew into constitutional reform of the electoral system, advocating the adoption of single member districts. Kukiz stood in the 2015 presidential, where he added a holistic criticism of the political class to his calls for electoral reform, picking up a surprising 20.8% to place third. Months later, he built on this momentum by creating an “association” to contest the parliamentary elections on broadly the same campaign themes. Despite winning 42 seats, the group collapsed early in the term due to internal disagreements. Both campaigns relied heavily on online platforms (Facebook and Twitter in particular) and were targeted at young voters (Kasprowicz & Hess, 2017:212; Olczyk & Wasilewski, 2016; Stanley & Cześnik, 2019:83).\nKukiz’15 is frequently regarded as “anti-establishment” (Fomina & Kucharczyk, 2016:60; Zuba, 2017:100; Stanley & Cześnik, 2019:75; Olczyk & Wasilewski, 2016:58; Lipiński & Stępińska, 2019:72), and “anti-system” (Kosowska-Gąstoł & Sobolewska-Myślik, 2019:22; Stanley & Cześnik, 2019:81; Szczerbiak, 2018) for its total rejection of the political class, which it regarded as corrupt and oligarchic (Kosowska-Gąstoł & Sobolewska-Myślik, 2019:16; Kosowska-Gąstoł & Sobolewska-Myślik, 2017:146; Kasprowicz & Hess, 2017:206; Olczyk & Wasilewski, 2016:59; Stępińska et al, 2017:315). It propagated a narrative of the “partiocracy” – an established network of professional politicians whose parties (including both CO and PiS) only pretend to differ in any meaningful way (Stanley & Cześnik, 2019:76) (OTH_POLCLASS = 3). For this reason it was very careful not to define and register itself as a party, but as an “electoral committee of voters” (Kosowska-Gąstoł & Sobolewska-Myślik, 2019:15). In line with its “ordinary person” appeal, candidates for the parliamentary elections were selected by a simple online questionnaire (Kosowska-Gąstoł & Sobolewska-Myślik, 2017:147) – one reason why it was so difficult to keep together after the vote.\nWhile the party’s programme was (intentionally) vague (Stanley & Cześnik, 2019:76), there were several core elements to its ideological outlook. Many of the party’s candidates and supporters were drawn from existing radical right parties (Kosowska-Gąstoł & Sobolewska-Myślik, 2019:22), giving it a nationalist and nativist politics (Stanley & Cześnik, 2019:76), often in accord with Kukiz’s own statements. According to Fomina & Kucharczyk (2016:60) it “spouted anti-European, nationalist, and xenophobic slogans but had no substantive program beyond reforming the electoral system.” Furthermore, Kukiz himself made several barely-cryptic anti-Semitic statements about Poland’s role in the Holocaust and the role of Jews in the former communist regime (Pankowski, 2018:25). While there is a case to be made that this did not quite reach the level of a 3 on OTH_ETHNIC (mainly due to the vagueness of the party’s positions), I’ve coded it such for now. Opposition to Syrian refugees was an important pillar of the party’s rhetoric in 2015 (Stanley & Cześnik, 2019:76; Lipiński & Stępińska, 2019:72), and Wciseł (2016:28) claims that the migration crisis was the “driving force” behind the 2015 campaign, even though he vacillated between harder and softer approaches (OTH_IMMIGRANT = 3). The party was “anti-European” (Fomina & Kucharczyk, 2016:60), and claimed that Poland had become a “neo-colony of foreign governments and international corporations” (cited in (Stanley & Cześnik, 2019:76). It also considered tolerance of refugees to equate to political allegiance to Germany (Wciseł, 2016:28) (OTH_FOREIGN = 3). There was an element of hostility towards foreign capital in the party’s discourse (Kasprowicz & Hess, 2017:210; Stanley & Cześnik, 2019:76), but these policies were not as important as the party’s nativism in its political discourse (Stanley & Cześnik, 2019) (OTH_FINANCIAL = 2).\nThe party’s economic ideology was very vague (Olczyk & Wasilewski, 2016:57) and its formal policies were a somewhat contradictory blend of conventional left and right. This coupled with the fact that Kukiz’s music had both left and right-wing themes (Olczyk & Wasilewski, 2016:58), and with the fact that its extremely open form of candidate selection produced an eclectic mix of leaders, makes it difficult to place the party on LRPOSITION (Kosowska-Gąstoł & Sobolewska-Myślik, 2017:147). Stanley & Cześnik (2019:85) claim that the party is actually centrist – that even though it had links and affinities with the radical right, its programme is actually vague and its appeal is built mainly on anti-political class populism. However most scholars seem to agree that the party should generally be considered “conservative”/“economic nationalis[t]” (Kosowska-Gąstoł & Sobolewska-Myślik, 2019:13) and “right-wing” (Lipiński & Stępińska, 2019; Szczerbiak, 2018:1; (Wciseł, 2016:28), and hence I have coded it R on LRPOSITION.\nThe party is clearly based around the persona of Kukiz himself (Olczyk & Wasilewski, 2016; Kosowska-Gąstoł & Sobolewska-Myślik, 2017:146; Szczerbiak:2016) (CHARISMA = 3), and was a genuinely new political force (Kosowska-Gąstoł & Sobolewska-Myślik, 2019:16) (INSIDER = 1). The party was extremely hostile to media criticism, and accused the (national and global) press of being complicit in maintaining the establishment (Kasprowicz & Hess, 2017:210). It is debatable whether this should land the party on LIBDEMNORMS – I’ve labelled it 2 for now."

    "text": "Thaksin Shinawatra, Thai Rak Thai, Phak Phalang Prachachon, Pheu Thai\nThai Rak Thai (“Thais Love Thailand”, TRT) was the political party of Thaksin Shinawatra. A telecommunications entrepreneur from Chang Mai, Thaksin was the country’s richest man in the 1990s when he served briefly in two governments as Foreign Minister (1994-95) and twice as Deputy Prime Minister (1996, 1997). Following the severe economic downturn following the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, Thaksin founded TRT to contest in the 2001 election. After landslide victories in that election and again in 2005, a boycotted 2006 poll was overturned by the courts, leading to a crisis which ended up in Thaksin’s overthrow by the military in September 2006 and the banning of TRT.\nAfter his ouster, the exiled Thaksin has been heavily involved in two successor parties that subsequently won national elections in 2007 and 2011 – the Phak Phalang Prachachon (“People’s Power Party”, PPP) and Pheu Thai (“People’s Party”, PT), respectively. Both parties were/are officially led by Thaksin’s inner-circle loyalists and family members, leading both to be widely seen in the literature as TRT by another name (see: Pongsudhirak. 2008:49; McCargo, 2008:340; Chen, 2014a:157; Sawasdee, 2019:103). These parties are also seen to be closely related to the pro-Thaksin and anti-coup “red-shirt” movement (contra to the anti-Thaksin “yellow shirt” movement that had demonstrated in 2005-2008) that blossomed in Bangkok after the PPP government was ousted in a “judicial coup” of 2008 (Sinpeng & Kuhonta, 2012:397).\nWhile Thaksin is universally called a populist in the Thai studies literature, this literature is challenging for two reasons. First the term “populism” is almost always used in the programmatic sense to describe social democratic policies “popular” among the rural poor – not populist political rhetoric per se (see Hewison, 2017; Hawkins & Selway, 2017). Hence the universal characterisation of TRT as a populist party in the 2001 election has more to do with its policies of subsidising health care, forgiving agricultural loans, and providing village level microfinance than any hostility to an “elite”. TRT’s 2001 campaign was also the first in which this kind of national policy had been the centrepiece of a campaign, as opposed to elite alliance-building reliant on local political bosses to drive turnout in the countryside (Pasuk & Baker, 2002:3; Choi, 2005:51) – something that is also probably relevant to its “populist” categorisation in the literature. Second, while there is literature that discusses the rhetorical form of the term, this tends to have an abstract evidence base that rarely quotes Thaksin, other party leaders, or campaign slogans.\nNonetheless, there are enough exceptions to this rule to study TRT’s potential populism in sufficient detail. This evidence suggests that the party’s initial election in 2001, while based on some anti-corruption platforms and a vaguely economic-nationalist (anti-IMF) reaction to the 1997 crisis, did not include any fundamental anti-elite populist narratives and should not be included in this dataset (see Pasuk & Baker, 2008:65; Hewison, 2010:121; Hawkins and Selway, 2017:384; Hewison, 2017:432; Thompson, 2012:68). Exactly when TRT and successor parties transitioned to an anti-elite populist discourse is debated in the literature. Pasuk and Baker (2004) suggest Thaksin’s reaction to the 2001 constitutional court case in which he was accused of violating asset disclosure rules while a minister in the 1990s. When awaiting the verdict, he publicly described the court case as a conspiracy of the ruling elite against him and “the people” who elected him, and that he would chose loyalty to the people over loyalty to the court (Pasuk, 2004:5; see also Case, 2007:632).\nIn the years following, he further honed a discourse that (ubiquitously) valorised the people and (more rarely) contrasted them to an elite establishment of “old politics” (Pasuk & Baker, 2008:79-80; see also Markou and Phanuwat, 2015:5; Jayasuria & Hewison, 2004:585; Norton, 2012:49; Pasuk & Baker, 2013:609-10). In one speech in 2002 Thaksin claimed that the government authority in Thailand had been abused to “serve the interests of those in power… Governments have enacted laws to sustain their own power rather than to empower the people who put them in office” (Pasuk & Baker, 2004:8). In a typically populist understanding of “the people”, he continued that ideology should play no role in modern parties, who should simply decide what to do based on “the needs and desires of the people.” (Pasuk & Baker, 2004:8). According to Hewison, (2017:434; see also Thompson, 2012:68) during the yellow-shirt demonstrations (after the 2005 election) Thaksin’s speeches “increasingly linked himself to his supporters and declared them a democratic bedrock against elite-controlled authoritarianism. Thaksin had identified an ‘other’; the Bangkok-centred elite.”\nAfter the 2006 coup, any vagueness regarding the people’s enemy disappeared in Thaksin’s political discourse, as he adopted the “full throated populism” against his elite rivals that he had been hesitant to use earlier (Hewison, 2017:427). For example, in one speech he claimed that “democracy was only for the elite. But now, people have filled their stomachs. And they want more. But the elite don’t want change that will affect their already happy lives” (Hewison, 2017:436). This anti-elite rhetoric has been evident in the red-shirt protests (UDD) that started in 2008 (note that it is generally accepted in the literature that red-shirts and pro-Thaksin parties – particularly Pheu Thai – are fused entities, see Sinpeng & Kuhonta, 2012; Sinpeng, 2014). In one speech Thaksin referred to a “power beyond the constitution” and an “invisible hand” as responsible for his overthrough (Thongchai, 2014:96, 104), following which the term “ammat” (or alternatively, “aphichon”) entered political discourse in reference to the aristocratic elite – i.e. the military, privy councillors, the democratic party, yellow-shirt protest leaders, and arguably (and controversially) the monarchy (Sinpeng & Kuhonta, 2012: 411; Prapart, 2011:2-3; Nelson, 2012:17; Chairat, 2013:206). Ammat is juxtaposed against the prai/phrai (“people”) who back Thaksin and his parties.\nThaksin is therefore another case in which OTH_POLCLASS rhetoric clearly rose from a small base, but where it is difficult to pin this down to clear points in time. Following the literature, I’ve coded TRT 2 for the 2005 election, and PPP & PT 3 after the 2006 coup (2007 and 2011 elections), although there may be a case to code 3 in 2005. Likewise, there is no evidence of anti-military rhetoric from Thaksin until after the 2006 coup (Connors, 2005:366; Chairat, 2013:206), after which this became a sustained element of his populism (OTH_MILITARY = 1 in 2005, =3 2007-11).\nIt is often suggested that there were nationalistic elements to Thaksin’s politics, particularly relating to the fallout from the Asian Financial Crisis and the counter-IMF common at the time (Glassman, 2004; Jayasuria & Hewison, 2004; McCargo & Pathmanand, U 2005:5; Somchai, 2008:108; Pye & Schaffar, 2008:46). As PM he also occasionally clashed with foreign funded NGOs and the foreign press, considering them both to be threats to “Thai sovereignty” (Pasuk & Baker, 2004:17-18; see also Pasuk, 2004:4). This however only seems to be a mild form of OTH_FOREIGN rhetoric rather than a core element of Thaksin’s populist discourse, and one that disappeared after the 2006 coup, when foreign powers do not seem very relevant to Thaksin/red shirt populist narrative (=2 in 2005, =1 2007- ). As the country’s richest man, he also did not present any OTH_FINANCIAL populism – on the contrary he promoted entrepreneurialism among the Thai population and claimed that his business expertise was the basis of his governing ability (=1).\nThere is also no evidence of OTH_ETHNIC populism. In fact Thaksin and many members of his government were from the minority Chinese community – an economically powerful community that had been somewhat political marginalised, and the TRT era is considered by some to have reduced this marginalisation and produced more acceptance of Chinese-Thai culture and politicians (Pasuk & Baker, 2004:11). In his first term included harsh policies toward refugees and migrants from Myanmar and Cambodia, but there is no evidence that this was a particularly important component of his populist discourse (OTH_IMMIGRANT =1) when it started.\nThaksin is very difficult to categorise on a left-right ideological basis (see: Hewison 2010:120). His most well-known economic policies (see above) are generally socially democratic. However he clearly had a generally neo-liberal view of economic policy and was hostile to bureaucracy and state intervention in general (see Pasuk and Baker, 2008:64). He occasionally claimed that he was applying a “dual track” economic policy of socialism and capitalism in equal measure (Ungpakorn, 2007:16; Pasuk and Baker, 2004:10). Given his core economic philosophy was more neo-liberal than leftist, I’ve coded him CR on LRPOSITION here – but this could be disputed. There is less debate about the role of charisma in Thaksin’s populism, given that he dominated the identity of his parties to the exclusion of all other senior members, and later incarnations in particular are personality cults around his leadership (see Pasuk & Baker, 2008:69, 76, see also Bo Kyeong Seo, 2019:556; Sawasdee, 2019:112; Thompson, 2012:75; Pasuk and Baker, 2013:610) (CHARISMA = 3). As his first election coded in the dataset is 2005, his incumbency since 2001 gives him 3 on INSIDER. Incidentally, he would have been a 2 in 2001, given that he had served as deputy PM and cabinet minister in the 1990s, and relied on many state connections to develop his business career (Pasuk & Baker, 2002:3; MacCargo, 2002:115).\nIn government, Thaksin opposed liberal democratic norms in numerous ways (Jayasuria & Hewison, 2004:572; Ferrara, 2015:361). He clashed with many of the oversight authorities which had been set up by the liberal 1997 constitution: questioning the authority of courts and sending emissaries to pressure judges (McCargo & Pathmanand, 2005:16; Pongsudhirak. 2008:54); clamping down on protest rights (Pasuk and Baker, 2004:19-20), taking personal control of the police (Funston 2002:313; Pasuk and Baker, 2004:20), and packing state institutions with family members and demoting politicians who clashed with them (Pasuk and Baker, 2004:12). On several occasions he likened himself to Thai dictators of previous eras (Pasuk and Baker, 2004:70) and articulated an authoritarian vision of centralised power which included no space for political debate – this being redundant given that serving the people was an obvious and uncontentious policy that required no ideological split (Pasuk & Baker, 2004:15; Jayasuria & Hewison, 2004:585). He was particularly hostile to media freedom, using his state and financial power to supress critical coverage of his government (Lee 2014:180, McCargo & Pathmanand, U 2005:193; Pasuk & Baker, 2004:15; Pasuk & Baker, 2008:70; Nelson, 2007:22; Funston 2002:313) and suing individual journalists who provided negative coverage (Pye & Schaffar, 2008:51). Thaksin’s war on drugs in the south of the country was also highly illiberal, including summary executions which he dismissed as “not an unusual fate for wicked people” (Mutebi, 2004:80; see also Connors, 2005:377; Pongsudhirak. 2008: 48). All of this clearly warrants a coding of 3 for LIBDEMNORMS."

FF was highly progressive on social issues, and became known for its leader’s confrontational style and opposition to the military junta (McCargo & Saowanee, 2019: 95, 100; Prajak, 2019:164).\nThis is a debatable inclusion, but on the balance of evidence it does seem that Thanathorn’s discourse against the military and the political establishment did reach the level of populism: In the words of McCargo (2019b:127) “his public criticisms of the military could be bold to the point of unthinkable”, and party activists claimed that the party’s mission was to “oppose hierarchism” (OTH_POLCLASS = 3, OTH_MILITARY = 3). I’ve seen no other evidence of OTH_FINANCIAL, OTH_IMMIGRANT or OTH_ETHNIC (all = 1).

To figures in the anti-military camp are occasionally considered populist in the literature. General Chavalit Yongchaiyudh’s National Aspiration Party was one of these, and was briefly in power before being thrown out after the 1997 crisis. Chavalit does seem to have a history of anti-elite statements (Neher, 1988:193), but it seems that NAP’s designation as “populist” is usually due to its policies rather than its rhetoric (Okey, 2005:742; Ungpakorn, 2007:112), and there is insufficient evidence that is should be included here. A somewhat stronger case could be made for General Chamlong Srimuang, a moral “puritan” (Chen, 2014b:195) of national politics who led the May 1992 uprising. Chamlong is considered a “populist figure” by some for this reason (McCargo & Parhmanand, 2005:8), but as with Chavalit I’ve not seen enough evidence of genuine populist rhetoric.

    "text": "Progressive Party / Centre Party\nProgressive Party (Framsóknarflokkurinn, FSF) is an agrarian party that has been one of Iceland’s major parties since its foundation in 1916. The party undertook a dramatic change in leadership and rhetoric after the in 2008 financial crisis, following which it alleged that Iceland had become the victim of foreigners (in part due to the specific issue of the “Icesave” bank collapse and its consequences). It alleged that the incumbent government was guilty of “treason” and “humiliating the nation” by showing leniency to the UK, the Netherlands and the IMF (Eiríkur Bergmann 2015, 46; Newhouse 2017) (OTH_POLCLASS =3, OTH_FOREIGN = 3). The party’s hard line position on the issue led to a dramatic increase in its electoral fortunes in 2013, when it surged to 24.43% (Önnudóttir et al. 2022, 40). It also campaigned against corruption in the banking sector as a whole (Hallgrímsdóttir and Brunet-Jailly 2016, 112) (OTH_FINANCIAL = 3). The new party leadership also gradually developed a nativist opposition to immigrants, associating asylum seekers with crime, and standing against Muslims and the construction of Mosques (Eiríkur Bergmann 2015, 48; Holbrook 2014; Newhouse 2017). However, there seems to be a consensus that the party fell short of becoming the out and out right wing nativist parties common in mainland Europe and Scandinavia (see for example Herkman and Jungar 2021, 247), and hence we’ve coded both OTH_IMMIGRANTS and OTH_ETHNIC at 2. Following Önnudóttir et al we’ve coded the party as CR on LRPOSITION (Önnudóttir et al. 2022, 2).\nDuring this time the party was strongly dependent on its leader Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson (Eiríkur Bergmann 2015, 48) although it had a well-established base as well (CHARISMA = 2 2009-13). Sigmundur Davíð joined the PP only weeks before the 2009 election (Harðarson and Kristinsson 2010, 524). The party won the 2013 elections and Sigmundur Davíð became Prime Minister, before being forced to quit after his offshore tax evasion was exposed in the Panama Papers in 2016 (Bernburg 2019). He then took his faction out of the PP and formed the Centre Party (CP) for the snap 2017 election, which (from the limited available evidence) seems to have carried the same populist narrative as PP (Önnudóttir et al. 2022, 22), and been even more centred on his personal appeal (Malmquist 2017) (CHARISMA =3). After this change in leadership the PP returned to its pre-crisis non-populist form (Eirikur Bergmann 2017, 94)."

    "text": "Citizens’ Movement\nThe Citizens' Movement (Borgarahreyfingin, CM – sometimes called the “Civic Movement”) was a direct offshoot of the “pots and pans” revolution that followed the financial crisis – named after the kitchen utensils that protesters banged together on the streets outside Parliament (Harðarson and Kristinsson 2010, 524; Bernburg and Víkingsdóttir 2016). This spontaneous set of protests brought down the Independence Party government that had overseen the neoliberal financial policies blamed for the crisis. CM polled 7.2% in the election, but disbanded son afterward due to infighting due to the conflicting priorities of its members (Ómarsdóttir and Valgarðsson 2020, 846).\nThe party positioned itself as an agent of radical change (Ómarsdóttir and Valgarðsson 2020, 845), and maintained a staunch anti-political anti-establishment character (Önnudóttir et al. 2022, 23; Newhouse 2017). In the 2009 election the party campaigned broadly against “the system, politicians and bankers” (Van Kessel 2015, 51) and according to Ólafsson possessed a streak of “militant radicalism” (Ólafsson 2019, 127) (OTH_POLCLASS =3, OTH_FINANCIAL = 3). It thus formed a left-leaning protest narrative that contrasted with the PP’s simultaneous nationalism (OTH_IMMGIRATNS = 1, OTH_ETHNIC = 1, LRPOSITION = L). The party won 4 seats in that election on a platform of “Let's bring the people to parliament” (Þórsson 2017). We have seen no evidence of OTH_FOREIGN discourse (= 1), but this could be further investigated.\nThe party is regarded as a quite “grassroots” initiative (Ólafsson 2019, 127), whose leaderlessness was evident in the way it collapsed soon after the election (CHARISMA = 1). We’ve seen no evidence that it threatened liberal democratic norms (LIBDEMNORMS = 1), and none of its leaders had ever served in government (INSIDER = 1)."

    "text": "Pirate party\nThe Pirate Party (Píratar) was a continuation of the CM, led and founded by one of that party’s four MPs Birgitta Jónsdóttir. It combined leftist opposition to the financial system with libertarian individualism and administrative decentralisation. It had a close association with Wikileaks (whom Jónsdóttir used to work for), and frequently raised the issue of press freedom. After leading the polls for months in the run up to the 2016 election, the party received 14.6% and thus became one of the best represented parties in the legislature. This dropped to 9.2% in the 2017 election. These results make the Icelandic Pirates one of the most successful Pirate Parties in the world.\nThere is much debate by comparative populism theorists about whether Pirate Parties should be considered populist in any way, and some have declared that Iceland’s is not populist (see for example Van Kessel 2015, 52). Iceland’s Pirates appear to differ from others within this family by being more serious about policy beyond the internet freedom issues that ‘Piratism’ had depended on (Newhouse 2017; Dapin 2017), and given the context of the banking crisis (associated with failure of the political class as a whole), the party appears to have had a more pronounced “anti-system” character in its discourse (Önnudóttir et al. 2022, 23) – albeit packaged in a very institutionally liberal approach. Newhouse, for example, argues that the Pirates picked up the mantle of anti-establishment revolt that had started in the pots and pans revolution and continued through the CM, culminating in the 2016 election campaign in which “the Pirates established themselves early on as the antithesis to the establishment politicians in power” (Newhouse 2017). On this basis, we’ve included the Pirates in the dataset, and coded them 3 on OTH_POLCLASS 3. Given their leftist orientation and their legacy in the pots and pans revolution, it seems likely that the party was also opposed to OTH_FINANCIAL elites – however we’ve not come across direct evidence of this, so we’ve labelled the party 1 for the time being. Likewise, we’ve seen no evidence regarding OTH_FOREIGN discourse (= 1).\nWhile the ideology of all Pirate parties is somewhat alien to the conventional left-right scale, the Icelandic Pirates appear to have adopted a generally left-wing approach to issues like welfare, healthcare, and housing (Ómarsdóttir and Valgarðsson 2020, 848), and hence seem to fit the L category on LRPOSITION. The party has never been in government (INSIDER = 1), and does not attempt to violate the norms of liberal democracy according to available evidence (LIBDEMNORMS = 1). The party possessed a relatively strong organisational base (Ólafsson 2019, 127), and as it formally has no official leader (Ómarsdóttir and Valgarðsson 2020, 847), I doesn’t seem to rely on its leadership for its appeal (CHARISMA = 1)."

While Gnarr joined Bright Future, available evidence suggests that this party charted a different direction to the Best Party (Önnudóttir et al. 2022, 119), and we have therefore not included it here. The People’s Party of Inga Sæland is a relatively young and small party has been considered populist in some literature. This seems to be due to Sæland’s occasional criticism of the welfare benefits that asylum seekers, and her focus on corruption.

    "text": "List Pim Fortuyn\nWilhelmus ‘Pim’ Fortuyn was a sociologist who emerged as a leader of a small and new party, Leefbaar Nederland (LD) (“Liveable Netherlands”), before the 2002 elections. The previous year he had written a book called “against the Islamization of our culture”, asserting that Muslim influence was a threat to liberal Dutch values. After breaking with LD and forming his own party, List Pim Fortuyn (LPF), Fortuyn was shot and killed while campaigning three months before the elections. Although LPF did surprisingly well in those elections with 17%, infighting led to its collapse soon afterward.\nLucardie describes Fortuyn’s politics as “an eclectic – but not necessarily incoherent – mixture of liberalism, nationalism, communitarianism and populism” (Lucardie 2008, 158). Fortuyn campaigned on the idea that bureaucrats, managers and ‘partycrats’ ran the country without considering the needs of average citizens (Lucardie 2008, 159; Van Kessel 2015, 102) (OTH_POLCLASS = 3). By far his biggest platform was his intolerance towards Muslims, including asylum seekers. In a notorious interview (that saw him sacked by LD), he claimed that Islam was a “backward culture” (Van Kessel 2015, 102) and that if it were up to him he would ban Muslims from entering the country (Akkerman 2005, 348). In Akkerman’s words, “his nationalist wake-up call became increasingly shrill. He feared the downfall of Dutch culture and Dutch society, and argued that people in Western Europe are living in a situation like the last days of the Roman Empire” (Akkerman 2005, 347). Unlike other far-right politicians in the region, this position was not rooted in a fundamentally socially conservative outlook, but one of protecting liberal social values which he considered Islam to be essentially hostile to (Akkerman 2005, 341). Due to this threat, the LPV manifesto spoke called for restrictions in immigration (Van Kessel 2015, 104). This clearly warrants a 3 for OTH_ETHNIC and OTH_IMMIGRANTS. Despite being anti-EU, it is not clear that hostility to the EU in the form of OTH_FOREIGN populist rhetoric is relevant here (= 1). Likewise, Fortuyn’s liberal rhetoric did not use any OTH_FINANCIAL rhetoric (despite being a former Marxist).\nFortuyn himself was a flamboyant and outspoken figure, and as the name of the party suggests, he dominated it (Lucardie 2008, 158; Koopmans and Muis 2009, 643) (CHARISMA=3). His ideology was liberal in both economic policy and social values, but included notable conservative streaks in law and order and the preservation of national culture (Lucardie 2008, 159; Van Kessel 2015, 104). In line with most stances in the literature (Van Holsteyn, Irwin, and Den Ridder 2003; Akkerman 2005, 344), We have labelled him R in LRPOSITION. We have also not seen any evidence that the party violated any LIBDEMNORMS (= 1). We have raised INSIDER from 1 to 2 in 2003 as the LPF was in a coalition government after the 2002 election."

    "section": "Party for Freedom",
    "text": "Party for Freedom\nGeert Wilders was an MP who fell out with hie Liberal Party over the question of Turkey’s EU membership in 2004. He went on to form his own party, the Freedom Party (Partij voor de Vrijheid, PVV) on the eve of the 2006 election. After success in this and the subsequent 2010 election, the PVV entered a minority government that lasted until 2012, when the party refused to sign on to the government’s austerity measures.\nIn many ways it seems that Wilders follows in Fortuyn’s footsteps: politically populist, culturally nationalist, avowedly liberal, and fanatically opposed to Islam. In van Kessel’s words: “Wilders appealed to the ‘ordinary people’ even more explicitly than Fortuyn, and shared the latter’s hostility towards the political elite” (Van Kessel 2015, 104). This included the allegation that “cowardly and frightened” elites of all major parties had “hijacked” the country from “ordinary citizens” (Van Kessel 2015, 104; Vossen 2011, 183) (OTH_POLCLASS = 3). Frequently, this elite is alleged to be the political left – or the “Church of the Left” (Coffé and Van Den Berg 2017, 878). In one expression, Wildesr argued for a more direct democracy: “Not the political elite, but the people should have the opportunity to express more often their will, because together the people know better than that left-wing clique” (Vossen 2011, 185).\nThe PVV’s central message lay in its opposition to Islam, with the party seeing Islam as a political ideology more than a religion (Lucardie and Voerman 2013, 193; Vossen 2011, 183). From 2006, Wilders began propagating radical conspiracy theories of the Islamification of Europe, suggesting a deliberate plot on the part of all Muslims to mask their true agenda of political domination (Vossen 2011, 184). Like Fortuyn, this was packaged in a peculiar defence of liberal and progressive social values – although according to Lucardie and Voerman the party’s liberalism diminished over time (Lucardie and Voerman 2013, 191). In the words of one party document, Islamisation “drives out Jews and gay people, and flushes the century-long emancipation of women down the toilet” (cited in Van Kessel 2015, 105). The party even claimed to support the integration of various non-white minorities like the Surinamese and Indo-Dutch (Vossen 2011, 185), and Wilders was a critic of traditional nationalism due to its destructive nature (Lucardie and Voerman 2013, 192). As with Fortuyn however, the fact that this is atypical of the European far-right in this regard should not reduce it from a 3 on both the OTH_ETHNIC and OTH_IMMIGRANT variables – especially the latter as Wilders increasingly targeted other migrants from Poland, Bulgaria, Romania and other locations (Vossen 2011, 185). With a somewhat mixed approach to economic policy, OTH_FNIANCIAL has not been a relevant factor for the PVV (the party’s economic platform has generally been quite liberal, albeit increasingly opposed to spending cuts) (Lucardie and Voerman 2013, 192; Vossen 2011, 186).\nWhere Wilders differed from Fortuyn is in the degree of his Euroscepticism. The party believes that the EU is a superstate run by elites indifferent to Islamisation and estranged from the interests of the Dutch people. This rhetoric hit a new level in the 2012 election (in the peak of the Eurozone crisis) (Van Kessel 2015, 106; Coffé and Van Den Berg 2017, 878), when the party started advocating for a full exit from the Union and a return to the guilder (the old currency) (Lucardie and Voerman 2013, 193). As a consequence we have coded the party 2 on OTH_FOREIGN in 2006 and 2010, and 3 since 2012.\nThe dominance of Wilders’ personality in the meaning of the party and his domination of its (barely existent) organisation (Vossen 2011, 180; Pas, Vries, and Brug 2013; Coffé and Van Den Berg 2017, 8; De Lange and Art 2011, 1240) warrants a 3 on CHARISMA, even if there is some debate about whether he fits the brief of a typically charismatic populist (Vossen 2010, 28–29). INSIDER is coded 2 since the PVV’s time in coalition government 2010-12 and 1 before. We see no evidence that the party condoned threats to liberal democratic norms sufficient to register on the LIBDEMNORMS scale.\nReferences\nAkkerman, Tjitske. 2005. ‘Anti-Immigration Parties and the Defence of Liberal Values: The Exceptional Case of the List Pim Fortuyn’.

Populism since that time has been most visible in the styles of several presidential candidates. Parties, however, are more challenging. Most studies suggest that parties in the Philippines are weak and decentralised, relying on patronage, local brokers, and machine politics to gain votes rather than centrally defined ideologies or messages (see Webb 2023; Kusaka 2017a, 53). It is a frequent practice for legislators to switch to the parties of victorious presidential candidates after they win, or for local leaders to back presidential candidates from other parties, both of which happened with Rodrigo Duterte’s election in 2016 (Cook and Salazar 2016, 11; Thompson 2016a, 52). Hence, while we’ve coded many presidential candidates here, but we’ve only coded parties in legislative (House of Representatives) elections when populist presidential candidates or incumbents are leading them. There may be a case for using only presidential results in the Philippines."

    "text": "Miriam Defensor Santiago\nMiram Defensor Santiago was a former law professor, judge, and cabinet secretary, when she ran for president in the Philippines’ second post-Marcos elections in 1992. Santiago had built a reputation and a following as a “graft-busting” firebrand within the outgoing Aquino administration (Putzel 1995, 27). Without a major party behind her, she formed the People’s Reform Party (PRP) and relied mainly on the support of urban students and supportive media organisations. She placed second in that election with almost 20% of the vote, after which she won a senate seat in 2005 and ran for president again in 1998 and 2016, polling below 5% on both occasions. Her PRP has never won over 5% of the vote in a legislative election.\nSantiago ran a “single issue” campaign against corruption in 1992 (Thompson 2010a, 124; see also Fontaine 1992, 178). This campaign targeted all members of the trapos (a reference to traditional politicians which literally means “old rag” in Tagalog) (Putzel 1995, 27, 38), rather than just specific corrupt actors (see Törnquist 1993, 487). She claimed, for example, that all three of her main presidential rivals were part of the “evils of graft, corruption and incompetence” (Shenon 1992). According to Fontaine she conducted her campaign with “evangelical fervor… freely employing King Jamesian biblical language to describe her crusade against corruption and corrupt politicians and officials” (Fontaine 1992, 178). Numerous other sources have also noted the “acerbic” or “ruthless” tone of her discourse (Thompson 2010a, 124; Pinches 1993, 94), and that she used insults against other politicians to build support among people tired of the political system (see Landé 1996, 16). While we could not find many specific quotes form Santiago that flesh out the specifics of this anti-politician narrative, this secondary evidence is sufficient to consider her campaign populist by our definition, and to code her 3 for OTH_POLCLASS.\nWe’ve not seen any evidence that ethnic groups, immigrants, foreign actors, or economic powerbrokers were relevant to Santiago’s campaign (OTH_ETHNIC, OTH_IMMIGRANTS, OTH_FOREIGN and OTH_FINANCIAL = 1). On the latter, Törnquist argues that she was friendly towards the business elite (Törnquist 1993, 487). She also had some close ties to the military (Putzel 1995, 31) (OTH_MILITARY = 1), although she would go onto be highly critical of its corruption in later years (Rivera 2005, 130).\nAs she was a cabinet secretary in the Aquino government, we’ve coded her 2 on INSIDER in 1992. Numerous sources stress that she had no significant party organisation behind her (Thompson 2010a, 125; Putzel 1995, 18), and that this was her major disadvantage. She therefore “relied solely on her popularity among the middle class” to gain votes (Parreñas 1993, 272), and on the media attention that she gained from “colourful attacks upon her detractors” (Landé 1996, 16). The PRP certainly seems to have been little more than her personal vehicle in 1992 (CHARISMA = 3). While her anti-corruption stances (and her background and a judge) would seem to support a stance in favour of liberal democratic institutions, before the election she claimed that “If I lose, it can only mean that I was cheated” (Shenon 1992), and she fought to overturn the vote in the courts on evidence that the literature considers to be very thin (Putzel 1995, 38; Timberman 1992, 116). For this we’ve coded her 2 on LIBDEMNORMS."

    "section": "Joseph Estrada",
    "text": "Joseph Estrada\nJoseph “Erap” Estrada was a former movie star who entered politics as the mayor of San Juan City in the 1960s. Soon after the fall of the Marcos regime he entered the senate - one of the few pro-Marcos candidates to win after the People Power movement. He formed the Force of the Filipino Masses (Pwersa ng Masang Pilipino, PMP) and ran successfully for the Vice Presidency (which is elected independently of the Presidency in the Philippines), where he served between 1992 and 1998 alongside President Fidel Ramos. In 1998 he ran for president, uniting smaller parties with the PMP to form the Struggle of the Nationalist Filipino Masses (Laban ng Makabayang Masang Pilipino, LaMMP) ticket and won in a landslide with almost 40%. LaMMP won 26.7% in the simultaneous legislative elections. Less than halfway through his term he was ousted by a series of protests and elite machinations that followed corruption allegations within his administration. Estrada was barred from standing in the next election in 2004 (where he endorsed fellow film star Fernando Por Jr.) but made a comeback in 2010, where he came in second with 26.8% representing the PMP. The PMP did not pass 5% in any other legislative election after 1998.\nEstrada is a very difficult case for the dataset. The literature universally considers him “populist”, but this generally appears to be for reasons different to our core definition. Specifically, his initial candidacy is considered to have merged his movie roles, where he tended to play outlaw characters fighting corrupt powerbrokers on behalf of the poor (Flores 1998; Webb and Curato 2019, 56). Studies of the “populist” characteristics of his political discourse have focused on his cultural identification with the poor (masa) far more than any anti-elite element (see Hedman 2001). For example, his campaign slogan was Erap para sa mahirap (Erap is for the poor) (Montinola 1999, 127), and he stylistically embraced lower class lingo and social habits that contrasted with other established national politicians, all of which built an indelible linkage between himself and poorer voters. The literature also emphasises that Estrada’s campaigns were the first to truly bypass traditional party machines and build a coalition of poor voters from multiple regions (Garrido 2017, 650; Hedman 2010, 109), fitting the more “politico strategic” conception of populism (see: Barr 2018).\nWe have found very few mentions of Estrada’s campaign rhetoric really targeting the elite as self-servings culprits of the plight of the poor. Kasuka notes that he “criticised elite rule and pledged to implement a new politics for the poor” (Kusaka 2017b, 96), and Thompson states that his campaign narrative was to “help the common tao (people) at the expense of the elite.” (Thompson 2016b, 279). Speaking more generally about the Estrada’s populist wing of Filipino politics, Thompson also says “The populist narrative portrays corruption as maintaining an unjust elite rule that oppresses the poor” (Thompson 2010c, 7). On his return to presidential politics, he seems to have taken a harsher and more explicit line against political elites, specifically those who removed him from power. In one election rally he gave what Arugay and Slater consider a “fiery speech in which he accused the elites of conspiring to unseat him” (Arugay and Slater 2019, 129), and in 2006 Claudio states that “he claimed that the military, the Church, and the business elite had all conspired against him in a grand ‘ouster plot.’ In particular, he pointed out the role of two of the most powerful business families—the Ayalas and the Lopezes—played in his removal.” (Claudio 2014, 549). He went on to note that these business elites opposed him because he opposed their plan to increase water prices in Manilla. There is a case for Estrada to be left off the dataset in 1998, but we’ve decided to include him with OTH_POLCLASS the only variable above 1 (= 2) for that election. By the time he came back in 2010, we’ve elevated his OTH_FINANCIAL to 2 and OTH_POLCLASS to 3 given his more specific accusations of elite conspiracy against him (and by extension, the people), however more specific evidence of his anti-elite claims from both periods would be useful to confirm this. Some literature points to Estrada’s anti-American positions in the late 1980s (Kusaka 2017b, 96), but this is not consistent enough in the writings on his election campaigns to affect the OTH_FOREIGN variable (= 1). Estrada’s initial campaign targeted the gap between the wealthy and the poor (Montinola 1999, 127), but we haven’t seen evidence that it targeted the rich as elite “others” to the ordinary people. The above evidence suggest that this changed by 2010, hence we’ve increased OTH_FINANCIAL from 1 to 2 in 2010. We’ve seen no evidence that Estrada considered the military, ethnic others, or immigrants in his campaigning discourse (OTH_MILITARY, OTH_ETHNIC, OTH_IMMIGRANT all = 1).\nEstrada’s campaign did not have a consistent programmatic agenda (Case 1999, 479), and what was included in it has been described as “a synthesis of pro-poor and pro-market polices” (Ferrer 2000, 241). In office he maintained the generally neo-liberal economic policies of his predecessor (Thompson 2010c, 6). We’ve coded him C on LRPOSITION to account for this ambiguity, but there may be a case to code him as CR. Given the absolute centrality of his persona within his and the PMP/LaMMP’s campaigns (Magno 2001, 261; Aquino 1998), and its unparalleled ability to command voter support beyond traditional party machines (Hedman 2010, 109), we’ve coded him 3 on CHARISMA. Estrada noted his admiration of former dictator Marcos (Case 1999, 478), but other than his various acts of corruption it does not seem to us that his campaign departed significantly from the established liberal democratic norms at the time. However in office Landé notes that he put significant pressure on the press not to publish critical content (Landé 2001, 91). We’ve therefore coded LIBDEMNORMS 1 in 1998 and 2 in 2010. Given that he was the sitting vice president at the time of his 1998 election we’ve coded him 2 on INSIDER, and 3 in 2010 after he had served as president."

When Estrada was banned from running in the 2004 election, he “anointed” Poe to stand in his place (De Jesus 2011, 212), and most studies write of Poe’s candidacy as if it was a continuation of Estrada’s (Thompson 2010b, 2). Poe stood as the candidate of the Coalition of United Filipinos (Koalisyon ng Nagkakaisang Pilipino, KNP) ticket that included PMP and other bigger parties.\nAs with Estrada we’ve found relatively little content for Poe’s campaign, but just enough to quality for inclusion in the dataset. In Kusaka’s words, “He sought to turn his unique resume as a high school dropout with no previous political experience into an asset, declaring that ‘unlike the elite, I am unaccustomed to politics and therefore unaccustomed to corruption’”(Kusaka 2017b, 124). Also like Estrada, Poe did not formulate much of a policy vision (Kusaka 2017b, 124), and relied on his personal popularity. We’ve therefore coded Poe the same as Estrada in every variable except INSIDER, given that he held no office prior to his campaign."

    "text": "Manny Villar\nManny Villar was the former President of the Senate and a strong ally of outgoing president Gloria Arroyo when he stood for the presidency in the 2010 election. One of the country’s richest people, he built a “rags-to-riches” narrative about his childhood that attempted to mobilise the poor masa vote that had supported Estrada and Poe in previous elections (Estrada even accused Villar of stealing his image by copying his orange theme colours (Thompson 2010c, 158)). Villar’s key narrative was that he, and not his opponents, knew a life of poverty and hard work (Garrido 2017, 651), and he developed a repertoire of using TV game shows to shower life-changing sums of money on poor contestants (Thompson 2010b, 17). Despite spending enormously on his campaign, Villar’s plan was frustrated by the fact that Estrada joined the race and seemingly split their target vote, coupled with the fact that journalists uncovered evidence that his rags-to-riches story was embellished with falsehoods about his childhood (De Jesus 2011, 215). He received 15.1%. and did not stand again.\nMost of the case literature considers Villar populist because of his claimed affinity with the masses and his targeting of the Estrada voter base, not his anti-elitism per se (see for example Garrido 2017). The fact that he was such a strong ally of Arroyo made him, according to De Jesus, “the most restrained in his campaign rhetoric against” the outgoing government (De Jesus 2011, 214). While this suggests that Villar does not quite meet our minimum definition of populism, we include him in the dataset based primarily on the evidence of Thompson, who claims that there was a current of anti-elitism in Villar’s narrative. Thompson cites reports that Villar accused opponents of being “self-righteous” and “elitist” in imposing their agenda on the people, referencing Villar’s comment that “These elitist groups think they are the only ones who can run this country. They had their chance; it’s time somebody from the masses took the lead.” Given the thinness of this evidence and the fact that Villar was a strong Arroyo ally, we’ve coded him 2 on OTH_POLCLASS, but this could be revisited.\nThe sources that we’ve seen do not provide any reason to code above 1 on OTH_FINANCIAL, OTH_FOREIGN, OTH_ETHNIC, OTH_IMMIGRANTS, or OTH_MILITARY. Given his position as an ally of Arroyo while he was President of the Senate, we’ve coded him 2 on INSIDER. Although he campaigned through the well-established Nacionalista party (one of the country’s oldest parties), source suggest he rebuilt that party around himself in the years before his 2010 campaign (Teehankee 2020, 114) (Thompson 2010a, 150), and coupled with his persona-focused narrative we’ve coded him 2 on CHARISMA. We have not seen much evidence of his ideology, but given that the Nacioalista party is generally considered a right of centre, we’ve coded him and it as CR on LRPOSITION. We’ve also seen no reason to think that his campaign violated established liberal democratic norms, and Thompson point out that he accepted defeat after the election (Thompson 2010c, 155) (LIBDEMNORMS = 1)."

    "text": "Rodrigo Duterte\nRodrigo Duterte was the long serving mayor of southern city of Davao when he ran for president in the 2016 election on the PDP-Laban ticket. The core theme of Duterte’s campaign was his willingness to use extraordinary violence to counter the nation’s supposed drugs crisis – a message that drew heavily on his record and “strongman” image in Davao (Teehankee and Thompson 2016). Duterte also stood out in the campaign for his vulgar tone and willingness to insult critics and opponents in ways that others would consider taboo (Webb and Curato 2019, 58–59; Casiple 2016, 181). This personality-centric style has been called “Dutertismo” (David 2016). He also differs from previous populist presidential candidates (notably Estrada, Poe and Villar) in that his support initially came from middle and upper classes rather than the masa (Teehankee 2016, 72; Thompson 2016a, 39). Duterte won in 2010 with 39%, though PDP-Laban polled under 5%. After that election numerous legislators joined the party, and it won 31.2% in the following 2019 elections.\nDuterte is universally considered a populist in the literature, but he is somewhat awkward for our dataset due to the fact that the primary “other” or “enemy” of his target “people” were drug dealers rather than politicians per se (Curato and Yonaha 2021, 387; Cook and Salazar 2016, 4), and hence he primarily practiced a form of “penal populism” (Kenny and Holmes 2020; Curato 2017). The political establishment did fit into this grievance narrative however, as he portrayed the political elite as enablers of the crisis due to their corruption (Muhs 2022, 153; Thompson 2016a, 42; David 2016) and “bleeding heart” liberalism (Curato and Yonaha 2021, 387; see also Kusaka 2017a, 64). In Webb and Curato’s words:\n\nThe enemy in this narrative is within the nation—the dangerous drug pushers, as well as the greedy and tone-deaf elites of Imperial Manila, including the corrupt justice system and those who turn a blind eye to the drug scourge (Webb and Curato 2019, 59).\n\nEarly in his presidency he would act on this by releasing a list of politicians, judges, and police generals who were allegedly complicit in the drug trade (Curato 2017, 151). Beyond the drug crisis, numerous scholars have portrayed Duterte’s narrative as being fundamentally anti-establishment (Cook and Salazar 2016, 4), anti-elite (Kusaka 2017a, 64; Dulay, Hicken, and Holmes 2022, 534–35; Heydarian 2017, 8; Casiple 2016, 181), and anti-oligarchy (Dulay, Hicken, and Holmes 2022, 531; De Chavez and Pacheco 2020, 271). He claimed to represent the “anger” of the unified Philippine people (Muhs 2022, 155), and was prone to labelling domestic critics as “enemy” when they opposed him (Pernia 2019, 63). One component of this was his somewhat regionalist hostility towards “Imperial Manila” (Thompson 2016a, 56; Curato and Yonaha 2021, 390). In Heydarian’s words:\n\nDuterte presented himself as an antiestablishment statesman, who is capable of overhauling a dysfunctional political system, dominated by a rapacious oligarchy and corrupt patron-client electoral practices (Heydarian 2017, 23).\n\nWe have not found any direct quotes from his 2016 campaign, but early into his presidency he stated that “The only way for deliverance of this country is to remove it from the clutches of the few people who hold the power and money” (Dulay, Hicken, and Holmes 2022, 534–35). There may be a case to code Duterte 2 on OTH_POLCLASS, however owing to the above evidence we’ve coded him 3.\nDuterte’s OTH_FINANCIAL stance is difficult because although he made statements against the “oligarchy” (Mendoza and Jaminola 2020; Webb and Curato 2019, 63; De Chavez and Pacheco 2020, 271), it seems that this term referred more to moneyed political elites and dynasties than economic others as a category per se. Other sources have noted that his rhetoric and supporter base transcended class division in a way that previous presidents had not done (Kusaka 2017a, 64; Arugay 2017, 286). We’ve coded him 1 on OTH_FINANCIAL, however this could be revisited.\nThere was a strong “anti-colonial nationalism” in Duterte’s 2016 discourse (Thompson 2016a, 53), especially targeting the United States (Teehankee 2016, 85; Heydarian 2017, 8) and any other powers seen to meddle in the nation’s internal affairs (Webb and Curato 2019, 61). At one point in his 2016 campaign he told western diplomats to “shut their mouth” over criticisms of his controversial comments (Heydarian 2017, 45). We have not seen evidence that this escalated to the point of considering domestic rivals as controlled by foreign interests, and we’ve therefore coded Duterte 2 for OTH_FOREIGN.\nDulay et al consider ethnicity to be central to Duterte’s campaign and appeal as the first major candidate from Mindanao, citing statements from the candidate such as “The thing that ruins [the Philippines] is that, for the longest time, the government has been held by the Tagalogs. It’s true! The way they look at their life, their dimensions, is Tagalog. It’s always Manila” (Dulay, Hicken, and Holmes 2022, 533–34). There may also be a regionalist or ethnocentric component to the “Imperial Manila” narrative in its appeal to the collective peoples of the peripheries (Kusaka 2017a, 64). However, we find that the evidence for this doesn’t quite extend to coding above 1 on OTH_ETHNIC, given that the preponderance of the literature notes that is campaign was fundamentally pan-ethnic (Heydarian 2017, 36) and inclusive (Webb and Curato 2019, 61). Even Dulay et al consider Duterte’s approach to other ethnicities was not “exclusionary” (Dulay, Hicken, and Holmes 2022, 534). Duterte even drew on his own mixture of Chinese and Muslim heritage to link his story to one of “national unity” (Kusaka 2017a, 63). We’ve therefore coded OTH_ETHNIC at 1, though more evidence of more statements against ethnic others may justify increasing this. We’ve also seen no evidence to code above 1 for OTH_IMMIGRANTS, or for OTH_MILITARY.\nDuterte’s campaign is difficult to place on a left right spectrum. He identified as a socialist (Curato 2017, 151) and maintained close ties with the communist movement (Heydarian 2017, 8), although this may have more to do with the Philippine left’s history of opposition to American influence than economic ideology (Thompson 2016a, 53). His actual economic policy has generally been characterised as liberal (Capuno 2020, 262) or neoliberal (Teehankee 2016, 85), and along with his clear nationalism this has left most to place him on the right (see Thompson 2016a, 51). We agree and have coded him R on LRPOSITION. Despite being a member of a political dynasty in Mindanao (Heydarian 2017, 33), he never served in any position in national government (INSIDER = 1).\nThe literature very clearly emphasises the importance of Duterte’s personality and charisma in his campaign and appeal (Kenny and Holmes 2020; Heydarian 2017, 9; Muhs 2022, 155; Pernia 2019, 62; Thompson 2016a, 57). Curato and Yonaha claim that his persona was highly paternalistic in this regard, as he “emphasize[d] his role as all-knowing father who demands the loyalty and obedience of his constituents” (Curato and Yonaha 2021, 387). Though his PDP-Lakas party has a history before his leadership, it was a “defunct” when he took over (Arugay 2017; see also Thompson 2016a, 52), and in 2016 and 2019 it seems to have depended totally on Duterte’s leadership (CHARISMA = 3).\nIlliberalism and violence is the most prominent characteristics of Duterte’s populism as depicted in the case literature (Thompson 2016a, 40). From the beginning of his campaign, Duterte’s history of violent policing in Davao made him a controversial “strongman” figure (Pernia 2019, 56). The candidate even called himself a “death squad” (Curato 2017, 150), and made threats to execute 100,000 criminals an leave their bodies in Manila Bay (Mccoy 2017, 516; Kenny 2018, 121). He explicitly claimed that his policies would constitute a trade-off of liberal values and due process in this regard (Webb 2017, 86). Though Philippine liberal democratic institutions may have been weak before his arrival, this rhetoric and legacy constitutes clear violations of LIBDEMNORMS (=3). This has continued after he became president (Pernia 2019, 61), although we have coded only his 2016 campaign."

    "text": "Jejomar Binay\nJejomar “Jojo” Binay served as Vice President between 2010 and 2016, and entered the 2016 election as an early front runner with the United Nationalist Alliance UNA. Previously he had served as mayor of Makati. His campaign was beset by corruption allegations and he ended up coming in a distant fourth with 12.9%.\nBinay is often referred to as a populist due to his “pro-poor” narrative and style being akin to Estrada or Poe in earlier elections (Thompson 2016a, 47; Webb and Curato 2019, 57; Arugay 2017, 281). However his inclusion in the dataset rests solely on the nature of his response to corruption allegations against him. In the words of Curato: “He sounded populist in dismissing all attacks against him as proof of the elitist government’s anti-poor agenda. ‘They don’t want us poor to come together,’ he said in his advertisement” (Curato 2017, 144). He also “blamed ‘the rich’ for attacking a born-and-bred representative of the Filipino poor” in his response (Sidel 2015, 225)” (OTH_FINANCIAL = 3). More data would be useful here, but we find that this is just enough to meet the minimum definition of populism, and to code Binay 3 on OTH_POLCLASS.\nWe’ve not found no evidence in the literature for coding above 1 on OTH_ETHNIC, OTH_IMMIGRANT, OTH_MILITARY or OTH_FOREIGN (all = 1). Likewise, we see no evidence that he violated LIBDEMNORMS (= 1). Given his position as Vice President we’ve coded him 2 on INSIDER. The UNA party seems to have been created around his 2016 candidacy (Teehankee 2022, 17) (CHARISMA = 3). We have coded him L on LRPOSITION (Thompson 2020) but this could be corroborated with more evidence.\nNot included\nGrace Poe, adopted daughter of former presidential candidate and movie star Fernando Poe Jr., ran for president in 2016, where her campaign has been characterised as populist by some (Webb and Curato 2019, 58; Teehankee and Thompson 2016, 128). However this seems to relate more to her stated pro-poor agenda than here allegations against the elite, and hence we have not considered her to have met our minimum definition. Corazon Aquino (who served as the first post-Marcos president 1986-92) has also been considered populist by some (Webb and Curato 2019, 56), but this appears to relate more to her stance against the former authoritarian regime than to her contemporary rivals.\nReferences\nAquino, Belinda A. 1998. ‘Book Review: Joseph Ejercito\" Erap\" Estrada: The Centennial President (1998)’.

The party ran on a populist platform promising to break “the tradition of political manipulation of the people” (Sosa-Buchholz, 1999: 148). The party concentrated most of its power in the poor suburbs of Guayaquil and their leaders “refused to identify themselves with the left, right or center”, emphasizing instead Ecuadorian popular ideology and the connection with the “jefe máximo” or supreme leader (Sosa-Buchholz, 1999: 148).\nJaime Roldós participated in the election as candidate because historic CFP leader Assad Bucaram, of Lebanese origin, was banned by the military from participating for not having Ecuadorian parents. The CFP criticized the military by arguing that the decree was an attack on Bucaram. Roldós, who was married to Bucaram’s niece, “expanded upon the techniques already developed by CFP leaders” by cultivating an image of the suburbs (Sosa-Buchholz, 1999: 151). However, soon a conflict arose between Roldós and Bucaram. In addition, their untimely deaths in 1981, marked the division and decline of the CFP. The CFP was then led by Ángel Duarte, a former minister before the military coup who participated in the 1984 and 1988 presidential elections. Although Duarte did not have the charisma of his predecessors (1 in Charisma), he continued with the traditional rhetoric of the CFP and has also been described as populist (Taufic, 1984). I have coded 2 for insider populism because although Duarte was once part of the government, it was before the military coup. He did not have any significant power in the new democracy.\nI have not found any opposition to immigrants, ethnic others or foreign threats nor did I find any departure from the incipient Liberal-Democratic norms that the new Ecuadorian democracy was establishing. It is difficult to establish the ideological position of the CFP. I have opted for Centre since they combine elements from both Left and Right, however, N/A would also apply."

    "text": "PRE\nAbdalá Bucaram, nephew of Assad and brother-in-law of Roldós, led the division of the CFP and created a new party; the Ecuadorian Roldosist Party (PRE). He is considered one of the most important populist figures in Ecuador (Sosa-Buchholz, 1999; De la Torre, 1997; Ulloa, 2017). Abdalá became the mayor of Guayaquil and then presented his candidacy to the presidential election in 1988, 1992 and 1996, finally winning the last year. Abdalá was known as “el loco”, the crazy one, and presented himself as a passionate politician who did not abide by the etiquette of traditional politicians. “He challenges their respectability [of the elite] by glorifying the qualities of the people, insulting his rivals, and acknowledging and accentuating his own ugliness” and employed “simple, humorous, direct, and authentically popular language” (De la Torre, 1997: 17; Moreano and Donoso, 2005). His ideological basis was summed in one of his campaign slogans: “Only one ideology, against the oligarchy” (Sosa-Buchholz, 1999: 153). As he stated once: “The oligarchy is an amorphous entity, an insensitive and exploitative system, an anti-Christian system. ... I think that the oligarchy is everywhere” (Bucaram, 1990: 24). De la Torre (1997: 16) argues that the oligarchy is incarnated mainly in rival politicians thus, for example, “in the 1988 elections, Bucaram presented himself as the child of Christ in struggle against ‘the devil,’ [Socialist leader] Rodrigo Borja.” Bucaram employed a moralistic language to frame the struggle between the people and the elite and contrasted the effeminate nature of the elite with the virility of the Ecuadorian people (De la Torre, 1997: 16).\nThe ideological classification of Abdalá Bucaram is complicated. Several authors coincide in the diffuse character of his ideology (Moreano and Donoso, 2005; Ulloa, 2017). He has been called a neopopulist because “he campaigned with a leftist discourse but implemented neoliberal measures during his government and formed his team with members of the oligarchy” (Ulloa, 2017: 118). He ran on the promise to improve the living condition of the poor (Sosa-Buchholz, 1999: 153) and had as a campaign slogan “the strength of the poor” (Ulloa, 2017: 117). In government, he applied personalistic measures such as the “Abdalact, cheap milk for Guayaquil’s suburbios, of free back-packs and textbooks, notebooks and pencils bearing the president’s name for poor students” (Sosa-Buchholz, 1999: 154). However, not only did he never question capitalism (De la Torre, 1997: 18), he even implemented strong neoliberal policies by inviting Domingo Cavallo, a former Argentinian finance minister, to advise him. He also showed a great degree of pragmatism forming coalitions with other parties or including members of the former conservative government into his cabinet. I have decided to code him as Centre-Left to reflect his pro-poor policies, although it should be noticed that, as other neopopulists in the 90’s, he shifted significantly once in government.\nAlthough the military did not form the main target of his attacks, he criticized it considerably. In 1985, he flew to Panamá because he was sentenced to four days in prison for saying that the military “had no other use than spend money and march in civic celebrations”. I have coded his position as 2. Abdalá tried to “incarnate the representation of Indians, cholos, whites, blacks and mestizos” (Ulloa, 2017: 120), thus, I have coded 1 for Immigration and Ethnic Others. On his leadership role it is important to point out that the party was created and led by Abdalá. No one disputed his leadership and his style was extremely personalistic. I have coded 3 in charisma.\nAbdalá was related to both Assad Bucaram and Jaime Roldós and was mayor of Guayaquil, Ecuador’s second most important city, before running for president in 1988. Therefore, he can be considered as a significant figure in previous governments (2 in Insider Populism). I have not found references or significant attacks on foreign powers or interests (1 in OTH_FOREIGN).\nAlthough several authors point to his “lack of respect for the rights of others” (De la Torre, 1997: 19) or his clientelism (Acosta, 1996), he did not deviate significantly from the liberal-democratic norms of other parties (I coded it as 1). In fact, when his economic austere policies resulted in widespread opposition, he was impeached by the parliament under the vague pretext of his mental incapacity and was substituted by an ‘interim president’ a novel figure for Ecuadorian politics of dubious constitutionality. A new constitution was approved, and elections followed in 1998.\nWith its leader gone and new elections coming soon, the PRE had to find a replacement and Álvaro Noboa was chosen as the presidential candidate for the 1998 elections. He was one of the most successful businessmen in Ecuador. Nevertheless, he lost that election and then founded the Institutional Renewal Party of National Action, or PRIAN and ran for president in all elections until 2013, coming in in second place in 2002 and in 2006. Noboa has sometimes been described as a populist (Nohlen et al. 2005: 372), however, his classification as such is contentious. Although he cultivates an image of a political outsider, in 1998, he stressed his technical abilities of management and differentiated himself from Abdalá Bucaram (Noboa, 1998). More importantly, as Carlos de la Torre argues, Noboa lacks the manichaean confrontation between the people and the power in his discourse (Ecuadorinmediato, 2006). He is better described as a personalistic leader more than as a populist candidate. Thus, I have not included him in the dataset.\nI have, however, included the party it the dataset since the party’s position did not change after Abdalá left office. In the 2002 elections, the last in which the party obtained more than 5% of the vote, the party was led by Jacobo Bucaram, Abdalá’s older brother. Jacobo was a sportsman and university chancellor who also became vice-president of the Congress between 1992 and 1993 and was major of the city of Milagro. He was known in the country for beating congressman Jamil Mahuad (who would later become president). He was in favor of the construction of a united Latin American currency that would help redistribute wealth and combat the problem of insecurity (BBC Mundo, 2002). He also wished to renegotiate Ecuador’s debt with the IMF and promote an agrarian revolution (BBC Mundo, 2002). Due to his political career as vice-president of the congress and mayor I have codified him as a 2 in Insider Populism and given that he inherited his brother’s party, I coded him as 1 in Charisma."

    "text": "Lucio Gutiérrez and the Patriotic Society Party\nGutiérrez was an unknown coronel without political experience (1 in Insider Populism) who became famous nationwide because of a coup d’état, in a similar fashion to Chávez. In January 2000, in the midst of a deep economic crisis, several factions of the military allied with indigenous movements overthrew the government of Pesident Mahuad. As Gutiérrez (2002) then declared: “from now on you, the people, will always be put first and those who have benefited from the people must step aside”. However, the military was not able to hold power and Mahuad’s vice-president was elected president. Gutiérrez was briefly arrested and later founded the Patriotic Society Party to run for the presidency in the 2002 elections.\nDe la Torre argues that Gutiérrez “employed the populist rhetoric of confrontation between the people, whom he said he represented, against the oligarchy, symbolized by the corrupt politicians” (De la Torre, 2008: 201). He also exploited the image of the military man as a man of the people who would not sell himself to “antinational interests” as well as his humble origins (De la Torre, 2008: 202). I coded 1 in Military and 2 in Foreign Interests.\nThe ideological classification of Gutiérrez is not easy because he was able to “coincile opposed tendencies as well as had an enormous flexibility to transform itself” (Montúfar, 2008: 269). He could be described as a neopopulist because of his rhetoric before and after achieving power. He campaigned on a leftist platform, particularly concerned with the indigenous movement’s claims. Moreover, he campaigned against neoliberal measures (De la Torre, 2008: 206). He was, however, less leftist than Chávez, as he himself stated “I admire the courage of Chávez… for challenging a corrupt government. I did the same in Ecuador. But I am not a communist. I am deeply Christian and respect private property and human rights” (El País, 2005). However, once in power, he soon broke his alliance with leftist and indigenous parties and supported himself with right-wing parties (Ulloa, 2017: 124). He then applied measures dictated by the FMI and appointed technocrats with ties to the business powers (Burbano de lara, 2003). The best classification I believe that fits Gutiérrez is to code him as Centre Left in 2002, 3 in Political Class and 2 in Economic Class.\nHis political platform was strongly based on the indigenous movements, which he identified as the main component of “the people” (De la Torre, 2008: 218) and he did not attack immigrants. 1 in both Immigration and Ethnic Others.\nThe Patriotic Society Party was created by Gutiérrez as a platform to run for president. The party did not do well in the legislative elections (2.5% of the vote share), which gives an idea of the lack of relevance of the party compared to the figure of its leader. The party later changed its ideological position when Gutiérrez did, which implies that it did not have a solid ideological basis apart from being Gutiérrez’s platform. I have coded 3 in Charisma, since Gutiérrez’s populism was entirely based on his persona.\nGutiérrez’s violation of Liberal-Democratic norms was patently evident. He became known in his country through a coup d’état against the elected president. His downfall also showed his lack of respect for LD norms. Due to corruption scandals, Gutiérrez’s alliance with the conservative parties broke down, and he decided to seek for the help of the PRE and Álvaro Noboa. He then proceeded to substitute judges in the Supreme court and those judges declared null the charges against Abdalá Bucaram. Massive protests followed and Gutiérrez declared the state of exception and ceased the Supreme Court judges. This was seen as an authoritarian intervention to the judicial power and, finally, the congress voted to substitute Gutiérrez with his vice-president, who also had become extremely critical of Gutiérrez’s measures. I have coded 3 in LD Norms.\nIn the 2006 elections, Gutiérrez was expecting to run for president, but the Supreme Court removed his political rights for two years. His brother Gilmar, who also had participated in Gutiérrez’s 2000 military coup and had been a congressman, had to ran instead (1 in Insider Populism and Charisma). Lucio was, however, able to run on 2009 and 2013 and was the undisputed leader of Patriotic Society Party since he founded the party (3 in Charisma and Insider Populism). During this time, his rhetoric was focused on his opposition to Rafael Correa. Gutiérrez did not lose his populist rhetoric, but the elite was now embodied by the government of Correa whom he accused of corruption (Gutiérrez, 2013a). Lucio called into question the transparency of the elections and criticized Correa for participating in the coup d’état that overthrew his “democratically elected government, thus violating the will of the people” (Gutiérrez, 2013a). Gutiérrez was also a critic of Correa’s closure of media outlets and called into question the impartiality of the Ecuadorian institutions, saying that they only benefited the president but not the people (Gutiérrez, 2013b).\nGutiérrez continued running a populist platform of difficult ideological classification. As Bowen (2010: 187) argues, he “generally eschewed well-defined platforms in favor of personalistic appeals” and “attempted, with some success, to mobilize clientelist networks that he had built during his period as president”. However, he moved from his initial leftist positions to become a critic of Correa’s progressive policies. He argued for the lowering of taxes (Gutiérrez, 2012) and had become, paradoxically, “the preferred candidate among the country's economic elite who see him as the only candidate capable of challenging Correa” (Bowen, 2010: 189). Thus, although he continued to be a populist leader, his definition of elite radically changed, and we could argue that his populism is mainly directed against a political elite (Correa and his government) and not anymore anti-economic class or anti-foreign interest. Therefore, I have changed to 1 Economic Elite and Foreign interest while keeping 3 for Political class and modified his ideology from left to Centre Right."

    "section": "Rafael Correa and PAIS Alliance",
    "text": "Rafael Correa and PAIS Alliance\nRafael Correa, who obtained his PhD at the University of Illinois, was a professor of economics in Ecuador when he entered into politics. Probably because of his technocratic profile, he was called by Alfredo Palacio to be Minister of Economy after the downfall of Lucio Gutiérrez. “He was the ultimate outsider—a college economics professor who had never even belonged to a party” (De la Torre, 2013: 35). He remained only four months in the post because he disagreed with the free-trade policies of the government. He then created the movement Alianza PAIS (Patria Altiva i Soberana) or PAIS Alliance (Proud and Sovereign Homeland) and won the 2006 elections. Although he was a minister, I have coded him 1 in Insider Populism because his time as minister was very brief and previously, he had no political experience or public exposure.\nHis platform has been repeatedly compared to that of Hugo Chávez (De la Torre, 2013; Ulloa, 2017). Correa argued for a “citizens revolution” that called “for the closure of Congress followed by elections for a constituent assembly that would write a new basic law. The underlying goal was to break the ‘partidocracia’ or system of domination by political parties.” (De la Torre, 2013: 36). Since his intention was to call for a constituent assembly that would create a new constitution and change the way the political system worked up until then, PAIS Alliance did not present any candidate for the legislative body. This indicated his aim to connect directly with the people bypassing the formal institutions of representation. Ulloa (2017: 127) points out the importance of Correa’s charisma and the concentration of party power in his hands (3 in Charisma).\nHis aim was to “refound the homeland” in order to achieve “a radical and rapid change in the existing structures of Ecuadorean society, in order to change the bourgeois state into a truly popular one.” (Correa, 2012). In his inaugural speech, he claimed that Ecuador needed to “get its homeland back” (Correa, 2006a) and argued that, under his government, “the fatherland was no longer for sale” (Correa, 2006a). “Correa presented himself as a leftist candidate, anti-international credit organizations, defendant of sovereignty; he employed an anti-political discourse that was, above all, anti-party” (Ulloa, 2017: 128). Correa defined himself as “socialist from a Christian, not Marxist, source; I like to define myself as a leftist Christian humanist” (Correa, 2006) whose platform was based primarily on fighting corruption and reversing neoliberal policies. He claimed that “we will never forget the crimes of the corrupt bankers who bankrupt us” (Correa, 2006a). Moreover, he stated that neoliberal policies whose “consequences have been disastrous” “were not only imposed but were also enthusiastically applauded by our elites” (Correa, 2006a). Thus, Correa claimed for a second Independence of Ecuador (De la Torre, 2013: 44) by which “Ecuador will become independent from international organizations, that represent foreign paradigms and interests” (Correa, 2006a). The most appropriate coding for Correa seems to be Far Left in Ideology and 3 in Political Class, Economical Class and Foreign Interests.\nCorrea had good relations with the military at the beginning of his presidency and although it later deteriorated due to spending cuts (ABC, 2016), the military was not a target of his populist speech.\nAnother of the pillars of Rafael Correa’s platform was what in Quechua is called the “sumak kawsay, which literally means ‘the life well lived’” (De la Torre, 2013: 39). The concept “comes from indigenous cosmology, and aims to build ‘the good life,’ understood as non-Western relationships between society, nature, and development.” (De la Torre, 2013: 39). This pillar was concretized in Ecuador’s new constitution with the definition of the country as ‘plurinational’ and the inclusion of “nature rights”. Additionally, Correa included a leader of the indigenous movement as president of the constituent assembly and finished his inaugural speech with some words in Quechua (Correa, 2006a). His relations with the indigenous communities deteriorated later due to disagreements over mineral extraction which the indigenous communities opposed to, but which Correa’s government thought necessary for the independence of the country (De la Torre, 2013: 41). However, neither immigration nor other ethnic communities were ever identified by Correa as part of the elite.\nAlthough Correa claimed to seek the democratization of Ecuador, his actions in government fall short of his electoral promises (De la Torre, 2013; Ulloa, 2017). Moreover, he launched several attacks on the media because, as he put it “the media have always been one of the de facto powers that have dominated Latin American countries.” (quoted in De la Torre, 2013: 42). Members of ‘El Universo’ were convicted of defamation for an editorial they wrote, and the newspaper was heavily fined as well. Moreover, every week Correa hosted ‘Enlace Ciudadano’ a three-hour show in which he criticized the media’s representation of his government treating them as political actors (Ulloa, 2017: 289). Insults and mocking of other political leaders were very common in his shows.\nFurthermore, his call for a constituent assembly has been questioned for its legality (Ulloa, 2017: 136,137). That possibility was not one of the prerogatives of the president in the constitution and it completely bypassed the legislative body. However, he went ahead with his plans due to his massive popular support. De la Torre (2013: 33) argues that Correa represents a case of “soft authoritarianism” similar to that of Chávez. Taking into consideration his attacks on the press, I have coded him as 3 in Lib-Dem Norms.\nCarlos de la Torre (2017: 39) points out that Correa, himself an ‘expert’ in economics as an academic, exhibited a kind of technocratic populism by which he had the knowledge to rebuild his nation and bring progress and modernization. Thus, he combined technocracy with populism. Lenín Moreno, vice-president during most of Correa’s years in power and UN special delegate on disability issues would represent this technocratic element in his government. Moreno won the 2017 elections with Alliance PIAS. Moreno has a leftist ideology and continues with many of Correa’s policies; however, he is less charismatic than his predecessor and does not employ the level of confrontational rhetoric that Correa did. Although many saw him as the marionette of Correa, he soon started to differentiate himself from Correa in what De la Torre (2018) calls Ecuador’s ‘perestroika’. Moreno has strongly persecuted corruption, removed the asylum to Julian Assange and engaged in a dialogue with all political forces, including Right-wing parties, moves that have been strongly criticized by Correa. Moreno’s case can be compared to that of Juan Manuel Santos in Colombia and his relationship with Álvaro Uribe, where a non or less populist leader inherited the party that the populist leader created. Following the criteria used with Santos and acknowledging that Moreno has inherited mainly Correa’s ideological basis but not so much his populism, I have not included him in the dataset. I have, however. Included Alliance PAIS in the legislative elections as a way to show that the party is still very much influenced by Correa’s personality (I changed Charisma from 3 to 1 to indicate the difference in importance of the leader). Whether Moreno will be able to change the character of the party in the future or not is an open question."

ND’s populism originally had a festive, parody quality (A. Widfeldt 2000, 494) that argued that “life must be more fun” (Betz n.d., 7). The party had a strong opposition to the political class (built in part on Wachmeister's books ridiculing politicians and bureaucrats) and its anti-establishment credentials were evidently a significant part of its appeal to voters (Rydgren 2008, 137) (OTH_POLCLASS = 3). It was quite dependent on the leadership of Wachtmaister and Karlsson (Taggart 1995, 41; Wörlund 1992, 138) (CHARISMA = 3), and collapsed electorally after their leadership splintered.\nWhile ND’s ideology was somewhat ambiguous (leading to splits in its eventual caucus) it should generally be regarded as right wing during campaigns (A. Widfeldt 2000, 495; Klein 2013, 116) (LR_POSITION = R). This included campaigning against immigration and for liberal economic reforms (Rydgren 2002, 34). Notably it was pro-Europe. Several of its candidates gained media attention for saying racist things through the campaign, and the party platform linked immigration to crime (A. Widfeldt 2000, 495). However according to Betz, the party’s immigration rhetoric was both moderate (in terms of policy proposals) and economically based (as opposed to culturally or racially based) (Betz n.d., 121). We’ve coded it 2 on OTH_IMMIGRANTS and 1 on OTH_ETHNIC. We’ve seen no evidence of anything on the OTH_FINANCIAL or OTH_ECONOMIC variables (both = 1).\nNeither leader had been involved in previous governments (INSIDER = 1), and the party did not violate liberal democratic norms as far as we can tell (LIBDEMNORMS = 1)."

    "text": "Sweden Democrats\nSweden Democrats (Sverigedemokraterna, SD) is a nativist anti-immigration and anti-Islam party, founded in the late 1980s. The party has a legacy in the neo-Nazi movement, with several of its founders being previous members of far-right parties (Anders Widfeldt 2008; Klein 2013, 117). From the mid-1990s the SD sought to detoxify its image and associate itself with other populist right parties in Europe rather than the anti-democratic and violent fringe (Rydgren 2008, 146; Anders Widfeldt 2008; Klein 2013, 117) – although not to the degree that is should be considered less than far-right on LRPOSITION. The party first passed 5% of the vote in 2010 (5.7%) under the leadership of Jimmie Åkesson. It’s vote share has consistently increased, peaking at 17.5 in the 2017 election.\nSD;s stated aim is to protect Sweden’s culture and welfare state from uncontrolled immigration, in particular from Muslim immigrants (Hellström and Hervik 2014). The party has a history of advocating repatriation of some immigrants (Anders Widfeldt 2008, 272), and in one 2010 election advertisement, the party showed a Swedish pensioner being overtaken by women in Burqas in the line to get to the social security office, with the tagline “Pensions or immigration: the choice is yours” (Klein 2013, 121) (OTH_IMMIGRANT = 3, OTH_ETHNIC = 3). In this sense, the party is a textbook case of welfare chauvinism (Norocel 2016), claiming to be the ideological air of the original social democratic tradition that Swedes are proud of (Hellström, Nilsson, and Stoltz 2012, 196). This nativist ideology has always been presented in an overtly anti-establishment attitude (Rydgren 2008, 147), with the party claiming to represent the views of common people over a privileged political elite in which all other parties are essentially homogenous (Rydgren 2008, 148; Hellström, Nilsson, and Stoltz 2012, 201). In Hellström et al’s words, “the SD portrays Swedish politics as an elite consensual affair with a distorted link to the people, arguing that the democratic system is bureaucratized and only serves the interests of the political elite” (Hellström, Nilsson, and Stoltz 2012, 201) (OTH_POLCLASS = 3). The SD is also hostile to the influence of the EU, and the cultural influence of the USA (Rydgren 2008, 147), although not quite to the point that these are principle ‘others’ of its populism (OTH_FOREIGN = 2).\nÅkesson has led the party since 2005, and while he seems to have been an effective re-brander of the party in its continued moderation (Anders Widfeldt 2008, 271), his leadership does not seem to be relevant to the point of our CHARISMA variable (= 1). According to Widfeldt the party has always pledged its loyalty to the procedures of liberal democracy (Anders Widfeldt 2008, 272–73). This could be debated given the party’s fascist pedigree (see Rydgren 2008, 148–49 for a sceptical view) but for now we’ve left LIBDEMNORMS at 1.

    "text": "Flemish Bloc/ Flemish Interest\nThe Flemish Blok (Vlaams Blok, VB) started in the late 1970s as a coalition of small parties who had splintered from the conserve People’s Union. For almost a decade it made no sizeable impact on Belgian politics until its first breakout success in the 1991 elections. Around this time it established itself as a radical right wing party representing the Flemish community in Belgium. After being sued by the official anti-racism body in Belgium, it changed its name to the Flemish Interest (Vlaams Belang) while retaining its organisation and ideology (Jagers and Walgrave 2007, 320). After declining consistently since 2007, it made a strong comeback in the 2019 election.\nAccording to de Lange and Akkerman (de Lange and Akkerman 2012, 31) the party’s ideology is built on an opposition to three groups supposedly hostile to the interests of the Flemish people: immigrants, people from Wallonia (French speaking Belgians), and the political elites from across the country. In 1992 the party published a seventy-point programme which, among other things, demanded that immigrants be returned to their country of origin (Pauwels 2013, 89; de Lange and Akkerman 2012, 28). It has repeated other forms of nativist rhetoric, such as its slogan “own people first” (Coffé, Heyndels, and Vermeir 2007, 143), and the repeated assertion that Muslim and Eastern European immigrants are involved in crimes at an “alarming” rate (Coffé 2005, 77) (OTH_IMMIGRANT, OTH_ETHNIC= 3). It has branded all other parties as, among other insults, a “political mafia”, and alleged that it is supported by a cultural elite in high society (Pauwels 2013, 90; de Lange and Akkerman 2012, 32; De Cleen 2016, 76) (OTH_POLCLASS = 3). Aside from these points, the party also favours harsh law and order policies and socially conservative policies aimed at encouraging women to have more children and outlawing abortion (Billiet and Witte 1995, 186). According to Pauwels (Pauwels 2013, 90) “economic issues are less important” to the party, and other than a general welfare Chauvanism, its position on economic policy is generally unclear. For this reason we have coded it FR on LRPOSITION and 1 on OTH_ECONOMIC. While the party is generally considered to be Eurosceptic, we have not seen evidence that this stance is important enough to register on the OTH_FOREIGN variable (= 1).\nMany scholars and commentators have alleged that the party is a threat to democracy in Belgium (Meijen, Raube, and Wouters 2023). Evidence for this lies in its wish to radically reform and centralise the Belgian state (abolishing provinces), develop a system of majoritarian referenda to decide policy, and its repeated attacks on media criticism (it calls such criticism a “witch hunt”, and has a history of bringing legal action against critical journalists (de Lange and Akkerman 2012, 33–35)). There is clearly a lot behind this assessment, but given that the party does not condone violence, nor question the ley of elections (as far as we’ve seen) we have coded it 1 on LIBDEMNORMS. According to some (de Lange and Akkerman 2012, 32; Pauwels 2013, 94) the party is not dominated by its leader. However the central position of Filip Dewinter in party for many years has led some to allege that is somewhat leader-centric. We have coded it 1 on CHARISMA, but this should be confirmed. As we have seen no evidence that the leaders of the party served in government, we have coded the party 1 on INSIDER."

    "text": "Not included\nNew Flemish Alliance (Nieuw-Vlaamse Alliantie, N-VA) is a more moderate Flemish nationalist party compared with the VB, and has arguably done well by attracting VB voters who think that the cordon sanitaire against the party makes voting for it superfluous (Pauwels and Haute 2017, 2). N-VA has been a challenge for populist scholars: while it has often used anti-establishment and ethno-nationalist rhetoric (Pauwels 2013, 86), it is not an anti-system party like VB, and each of the variables most associated with right wing populism (OTH_POLCLASS, OTH_IMMIGRANTS, and OTH_ETHNIC) are notably softer in the N-VAs rhetoric than a typical populist party by our definition. Leader Bart De Wever has sought to clearly distinguish the party from VB’s nativism: “We strive for an inclusive citizenship that is acquirable for everyone, even for foreigners. That is inconceivable for the VB” (Maly 2016, 271). For these reasons, several populist scholars have studied the party but concluded that it should not be called populist (Pauwels 2013; Van Kessel 2015, 37). There are two other populist parties of note since 1980 that have not past the 5% threshold. List Dedecker is a charisma-based neo-liberal populist party but only peaked at 4% in 2007. The Wallonian Front National, seen as a kind of French-speaking equivalent to the VB, has also performed poorly.\nReferences\nBilliet, Jaak, and Hans De Witte. 1995. ‘Attitudinal Dispositions to Vote for a “New” Extreme Right-Wing Party: The Case of “Vlaams Blok”’.

    "text": "Edi Rama, Socialist Party of Albania\nThe only Albanian populist figure who reaches the 5% threshold since the return to multiparty parliamentary elections in 1992 is the Socialist Party of Albania (PS) leader Edi Rama. Rama is a former artist and basketball player who served as Mayor of Tirana between 2000 and 2011 and who took over the leadership of the PS in 2006 – the first leader of the party not to have been a member of the Albanian Communist Party (Kajsiu 2016, 289). Rama’s ascent to power took place among massive protests in 2011 following corruption allegations within the previous coalition government (Kajsiu 2014, 112). He was elected Prime Minster with a minority government in 2013 and re-elected with an outright majority in 2017.\nAccording to several sources, in the years before his first national election in 2013, as Mayor Rama mastered a kind of “anti-politics” rhetoric that lent heavily on populist conceptions of ordinary people being held back by the elite (Kajsiu 2010, 245; Budini 2012). He was part of a group who, after the transition from communism, “came to define themselves against political parties and politicians” as part of an “anti-political project” (Budini 2012), which, in combination with his artist background and personalistic style, has led him to be classified by Budini as Albania’s “pop(ulist) star” (Budini 2008). In Kajsiu’s words:\n\nEdi Rama, trans­formed the antipolitics discourse from an attack on politics in general into an attack against the “old politics” in the name of a new one. According to him the old politics of the past had caused much damage to Albania and Albanians, it had “poisoned the blood of Albanian society, it [had] halted her and her development.” (Kajsiu 2010, 245)\n\nWhile some of this language is boilerplate in post-communist Albania, Rama seems to have taken it to a new level. He ran on an anti-corruption platform which targeted the entire state and political elite, claiming that corruption was “endemic in every cell of the state organism and in every contact of the state with the extended hand of the citizen that is asking for a service” (Kajsiu 2021, 40). Rama accused one incumbent, Ilir Meta of the Socialist Movement for Integration (SMI) of representing “everything that is rotten in Albanian Politics” (though he subsequently joined a coalition with him for the 2013 elections) (Kajsiu 2014, 113). He also called the incumbent government of Berisha Sali a “regime of thievery and extortionists”, and a “morally fallen power, rotten to its core” (Heba 2017, 11). In contrast to the political status quo, he has styled himself as a “political outsider” (Lela 2016, 44), declaring in 2009 “I am not a politician! I want to say this out loud. I am a citizen, like you, like many others” (Kajsiu 2010, 246). He has governed in a personalist way – for example having his supporters directly submit the names of corrupt officials whom he subsequently black listed, and campaigning in 2017 on a platform of “co-governance with common people” (André 2017). There is a dearth of English language sources on Rama’s rhetoric after becoming Prime Minister – however, owing to what has been written earlier we have coded him 3 on OTH_POLCLASS.\nHe has attacked critical media with significant vitriol (André 2017), but we do not think that this escalates to a 2 on the LIBDEMNORMS variable (= 1). We found no evidence for any rhetoric on the OTH_IMMIGRANTS, OTH_MILITARY, OTH_ECONOMIC or OTH_ETHNIC variables (each = 1). Rama has engaged in some nationalistic rhetoric against Albania’s neighbours (see Rrustemi 2020), but not to the point of identifying their hand in the people’s grievances (OTH_FOREIGN = 1).\nAccording to most sources Rama is notably “charismatic” (Fras 2017; Triantis, n.d.), and his campaigns have turned the PS into a “one-man show” (Kalemaj 2020, 32). However, given the existing strength of the party before his rise we’ve coded it 2 on CHARISMA. Despite the fact that Rama has advocated for the irredentist cause of “Greater Albania” including ethnic Albanian Kosovo and parts of North Macedonia, and has been called a “nationalist” (Rrustemi 2020, 19, 25), he clearly belongs to the centre left tradition in Albanian politics (LRPOSITION = CL). Owing to his non-political past we’ve coded him 1 on INSIDER up to 2013 and 3 after he became Prime Minister in 2013.\nReferences\nAndré, Jérôme. 2017. “Co-Governance with Citizens — What Kind of Democracy under Edi Rama?” Exit - Explaining Albania (blog).

    "text": "Progress Party\nThe Danish Progress Party (Fremskridtspartiet, FrP) was established in the 1970s as a libertarian anti-tax party by eccentric tax lawyer Mogens Glistrup. Glistrup had famously bragged on TV that his evasion of tax constituted heroism on par with wartime resistance (Widfeldt 2000, 489). The party achieved success early on, winning 15.9% in 1973, but subsequently declined to 3.6% by 1984 when Glistrup was imprisoned for tax evasion (Klein 2013, 106). He was replaced by Pia Kjærgaard, whose star rose throughout the 1990s as a more pragmatic face of Glistrup’s provocative positions (Klein 2013, 107). This coincided with a turn towards anti-immigration politics alongside the party’s well established neoliberalism. After the Glistrup was released from prison, a factional battle ensued between anti-compromise hardliners (led by Glistrup) and relatively pro-compromise pragmatists (led by Kjærgaard), resulting in the latter faction breaking off to for the Danish People’s Party (see below) and the decline of Progress to irrelevance by 2000s (J. G. Andersen and Bjørklund 2000, 197).\nBound to Progress’ anti-tax position was a deep anti-establishment criticism of the political class (J. G. Andersen and Bjørklund 1990, 201; J. Andersen 2004; Siim and Meret 2016, 116) (OTH_POLCLASS = 3). In the mid-1980s the party turned attention more toward opposition to multiculturalism and immigration on increasingly ethnocentric lines (J. Andersen 2004, 3). Rydgren cites 1985 as the year this occurred, in part because the party learned from the breakout success of the Front National in the 1984 French elections (Rydgren 2004, 480) (OTH_IMMIGRANT = 1 1981-1984, 3 1987-2001). In later elections Glistrup called for Muslim girls to be “sold to Paraguay”, and proudly declared “Of course I’m a racist – all good Danes are. Either you’re a racist or a traitor” (Widfeldt 2000, 490). Progress campaigned in 2001 for a “Mohammedan-free Denmark” (Rydgren 2004, 487). We have therefore increased OTH_ETHNIC form 1 to 3 simultaneous to OTH_IMMIGRANT.\nParty leadership, initially by Glistrup and then by Kjærgaard has clearly been a very important element of Progress’ meaning and appeal. The former had a complicated role in the part after his return from prison, acting as a kind of figurehead even when he was at odds with the official party leadership (Rydgren 2004, 480). Glistrup also tried actively to prevent the party from organising beneath him (J. G. Andersen and Bjørklund 2000, 201). While this subject could be debated, we have coded Progress 3 on CHARISMA for its duration. We have seen no evidence that the party should register on the LIBDEMNORMS variable (= 1), nor that any of its leaders have been present in previous governments (INSIDER = 1)."

    "text": "Danish People's Party\nFounded after the split within Progress in 1995, the Danish People’s Party (Dansk Folkeparti, DF) was less tax-focused and more dedicated to cultural issues, especially opposing Muslim immigration. From the outset, Kjærgaard positioned the party as a credible alternative to major parties and expelled more extreme members (Klein 2013, 108). DF participated in several governing coalitions with mainstream conservative parties from 2001-2011 and 2015-2019, making it one of the most successful right-wing populist parties in Europe.\nAttacks on the political establishment have always been a pillar of the DF (Kosiara-Pedersen 2020, 321). The party has always referred to politicians as ‘they’ rather than ‘we’ – even when it was a member of coalition government after 2001 (Rydgren 2004, 486; see also Awad, Doerr, and Nissen 2022, 999). Several sources point out that Kjærgaard’s approach to this matter is not as extreme as Glistrup (J. Andersen 2004, 3; Rydgren 2004, 487; Kosiara-Pedersen 2020, 321), and Rydgren contends that this type of rhetoric became “less aggressive” after it joined the governing coalition in 2001 (Rydgren 2004, 486). While this could be considered cause for a reduction in the OTH_POLCLASS variable, we’ve left it at 2 from the party’s first election in 1998.\nThe party has always been explicitly hostile to ethnic others and immigrants (Siim and Meret 2016, 21). In 2002, for example, it stated that “Denmark is not an immigrant-country and never has been. Thus we will not accept transformation to a multiethnic society… Denmark belongs to the Danes” (Klein 2013, 110) (OTH_IMMIGRANT = 3). The party is especially hostile to Muslim immigrants (Siim and Meret 2016, 126), asserting that cultural integration is impossible and that Muslims, in the words of DF MEP Mogens Camre, have “come to take over Denmark” (Klein 2013, 111; see also Rydgren 2004, 485) (OTH_ETHNIC = 3). This is often packaged in a welfare chauvinism perspective that ties mass immigration to the draining of welfare to those Danes who deserve it (Careja et al. 2016; Rydgren 2004, 486). While the party has occasionally expelled overtly racist members and groups, this does not mean that it should be coded less than 3 on either of these two registers. While the DF had dropped the neoliberalism of Progress, notably by defending aspects of the welfare state (J. Andersen 2004, 4; Siim and Meret 2016, 116), this has not led to an OTH_FINANCIAL populism (= 1). The DF is against the EU, but only to the level of 2 on OTH_FOREIGN. The party’s economic ideology has been considered centrist or centre left (Jordan 2022, 5; Nicolaisen 2023), however due to the salience of its of its ethnonationalist rhetoric it is universally considered far right, and we agree (LRPOSITION = FR).\nThe dominant leadership of Kjærgaard (Meret 2015; J. Andersen 2004, 4; Siim and Meret 2016, 120) seems to warrant 3 for CHARISMA while she led the party, and while her successor Kriastian Thulesen Dahl is also generally popular, it does not seem accurate to call the party leader-defined under his tenure (= 1 from 2015). After it joined coalition government in 2001 we have coded it 2 on INSIDER. we have seen no evidence that the party has violated LIBDEMNORMS.\nReferences\nAndersen, Jørgen. 2004. ‘The Danish People’s Party and New Cleavages in Danish Politics’, January.\nAndersen, Jørgen Goul, and Tor Bjørklund. 1990. ‘Structural Change and New Cleavages: The Progress Parties in Denmark and Norway’.

    "text": "FMLN\nEl Salvador suffered a Civil War from 1980 until 1992. The war started when El Salvador was controlled by a military-led Junta and confronted the Government against the FMLN. During the Civil War, the FMLN was an umbrella organization that coordinated, at least, 5 left-wing guerrilla groups. El Salvador approved a new constitution in 1983, held its first truly democratic elections in 1984 and reached a peace agreement with the FMLN in 1992. The Chapultepec Peace Accords included the demobilization of armed forces and the legalization of the FMLN as a political party. Since the 1994 presidential elections, the FMLN has become the main left-wing party of the country.\nThe inclusion of a Marxist guerrilla in a classification of populist parties is bound to be contested by those who see populist and communist political discourses as categorically different. However, there are many elements in common. The FMLN makes a clear distinction between the masses and the elite in the form of an oppressive state and, after 12 years of Civil War, considers the “other” as enemies rather than as political adversaries. Nonetheless, the FMLN accepted the democratic route to gain power (Zamora, 1998: 227). Sprenkels (2018) argues that the party went through an “ambivalent moderation” in which the party was recurrently in internal conflict between the different factions within it. It should be noted that the FMLN is far from an ideologically unified party and it has had numerous internal struggles.\nAllison and Martin (2012) explain that the party has been torn apart by two main tendencies: one the one side the “orthodox” or “revolutionary socialists”, which saw peace as the next step towards achieving the revolution and were more ideologically radical and on the other side the “moderates” or “renovators” which argued that the peace was the revolution and which moderated their discourse. In the internal clashes between these broad tendencies, the hard-liners managed to hold control of the organization most of the time and this led to up to three splits from the moderate faction and the creation of new parties. However, since all of these new parties failed to achieve significant electoral support and the FMLN increased its share of votes election after election, the main position of the FMLN lied with the “orthodox”. After the first split in 1994 election, for example, the remining organizations in the FMLN “reaffirmed their identities as Marxist revolutionary organizations and their intent on constructing socialism” (Allison and Martin, 2012: 99). Moreover, the FMLN document outlining its principles displays a commitment to “serve the interests of the majority” and a strong patriotism (FMLN, 2011). Therefore, I labelled 3 in Political class and Financial Elite and FL as the ideology of the party.\nSprenkels (2018: 15) states that “in government, the FMLN has done little to enhance institutional checks and balances”. It even tried to undermine the country’s Supreme Court’s independence (Réserve, 2016: 192). Additionally, Mauricio Funes fled the country because he was being investigated for corruption. Moreover, the victory of the orthodox faction in the 2000s led to a reinstating of the Leninist understanding of the party and to the suppression of the internal democratic elections to choose candidates (Acevedo Moreno, 2006). Furthermore, clientelism was a practice well extended within the party (Sprenkels, 2018: 15). I believe these elements deserve a 3 in violation of LD norms.\nOn Foreign Policy Interests, the party held a “vocal opposition to the country’s dollarization and participation in any free trade agreement with the US” (Sprenkels, 2018: 13) and displayed a continuous anti-imperialistic sentiment (Sprenkels, 2018: 17). However, Mauricio Funes has taken a different direction and has strengthened commercial and political relations with the US despite disagreement from the FMLN leadership (Allison and Martín, 2012: 112). I have coded 3 for Foreign Policy since 1994 with the exception of the period of Mauricio Funes where I have coded 2 in order to show this more moderate -but not fully welcoming- position regarding the US.\nAfter 12 years of Civil War, the demilitarization of the country was seen as essential to achieve peace and it was one of the main objectives of the FMLN (Zamora, 2017). According to the FMLN, the military participated and perpetuated crimes during the war and formed part of the state’s repression. However, the main enemies were the paramilitary death squadrons and the demilitarization was effectuated according to the Peace Accord. Therefore, I have coded 2 for military because it is possible to distinguish between the military and the political elite and the former received most of the criticism.\nNone of the presidential candidates belonged to the inner circle of decision making of the previous government with the exception of Salvador Sánchez Cerén, who was Funes’ vice-president and Hugo Martínez, who was Sánchez Cerén’s Minister of Foreign Affairs. The FMLN is based on an endogenous ideology and is not based on the personality of any leader. In fact, according to Allison and Martín (2012) the FMLN owed part of its defeats to the selection of unpopular presidential candidates within the pool of former guerrilla leaders. Mauricio Funes represented a departure in this tendency and run on a platform supported not only by the FMLN but by an organization called “Friends of Funes” completely based on his personal figure. Therefore, I have coded all elections 1 in Inner Populism until 2012 and 3 in the remaining elections. I labelled all elections 1 for Personality Dependent except for 2009. Immigration and ethnic others are not depicted as enemies or threats for the FMLN."

    "text": "Nayib Bukele\nNayib Bukele became president of El Salvador in 2019. He is a former businessman from Palestinian origins that belonged to the FMLN. With this party, he became the mayor of the capital, but he did not take part in the national government of the FMLN (1 in Insider Populism). He created a new party in 2017 and was expelled from the FMLN. The new party, however, was forbidden by the courts to run in the 2019 elections because the inscription period had already pass. Bukele decided, then, to be the presidential candidate of GANA, a right-wing party. It is still unsure how much influence will this party have in his government but Bukele argues that it used that party only as a necessary means to an end (ABC, 2019) and openly disagrees with some of its ideas. It is difficult to pin down Bukele’s ideology. Some argue that he is a “classic populist” for which the categories of left and right are not useful any more (BBC, 2019). However, given its emphasis in the country’s poor in his discourses, his previous membership of the FMLN and his self-definition as progressive, I have coded Left as his ideology. Moreover, the fact that Nayib Bukele presented itself as the candidate of a party with a different ideology, based the campaign solely in his figure and still won the election in the first round, shows the extreme importance of the personality of the presidential candidate. I labelled 3 in Personality Dependent.\nThe main axis of Bukele’s campaign consists in presenting himself as an outsider that will fight the corruption of the two ruling parties (ABC, 2019). He argues that the inefficient and corrupt management of the previous governments is responsible for El Salvador’s deplorable economic and social situation. He defended that “this battle is for every person from El Salvador that has been ignored by their governments” (Bukele, 2019a) and used short mottos such as “they should return what they stole” or “there is enough money when nobody steals it” to depict the previous governments as corrupt. Thus, I have coded 3 for “Political Class”.\nAs a businessman himself, Bukele aims at creating a productive economy for El Salvador that will improve the conditions of the country. He did not display animosity against the financial elite but defined the elite in primarily political terms. Therefore, I believe 1 in Financial Elite accurately reflects his position.\nOn Foreign Interests, Bukele has repeated constantly his desire to “re-establish, improve and increase relations with the US” (Bukele, 2019b). Bukele has not displayed any antagonism against any other country but has harshly criticized Maduro’s (Venezuela) and Ortega’s (Nicaragua) governments for using force to remain in power (BBC, 2019), which contrasts with the position taken by Sánchez Cerén. Being himself of migrant origins Bukele made no negative mention of incoming migrants or ethnic groups. Lastly, Bukele has not taken any action against LD norms.\nReferences\nABC (2019) “Interview with Nayib Bukele”, 1 February: https://www.abc.es/internacional/abci-niyab-bukele-no-negocio-maras-lidio-comunidades-donde-viven-familias-201811080221_noticia.html\nAcevedo Moreno, H.

    "text": "The Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (Hnutie za demokratické Slovensko, HZDS) split off from the major Slovakian anti-communist dissident movement Public Against Violence (VPN) in 1991 (Bútora and Bútorová 1993, 79). Throughout the 1990s it was the major party of government, with its founder and leader Vladimir Mečiar serving as Prime Minister three times between 1990 and 1998 (throughout the period of the Velvet Divorce form Czechia). After the 1994 elections HZDS governed in coalition with two other smaller populist parties, the Slovak National Party (SNS) and the Union of Slovak Workers (ZRS). This government was defeated in 1998. The party added the words “People’s Party” to the end of its name (HZDS-ĽS) in 2000, but its support steadily declined in subsequent elections. Still under Mečiar’s leadership, HZDS joined the new Smer government after the 2006 elections (where it polled 8.79%), but its vote dropped below 5% in the subsequent 2010 elections and it formally dissolved in 2014.\nDespite the fact that HZDS was always a core part of the political establishment of the Slovak Republic, it portrayed itself as representing ordinary people against a “‘grand coalition’ of forces conspiring to remove it from power” (Stanley 2017, 149–50). It often relied on grandiose rhetoric that depicted its opponents as “evil ones opposing Slovakia” (Ferencei 2020, 168), or simply “enemies of Slovakia” (Haughton 2003a, 269; Abrahám 1995, 99). These attacks often targeted other figures within the state, (including Mečiar’s archrival President Michal Kováč) whom the party collectively accused of trying “destroy the political system in Slovakia” in 1995 (Deegan-Krause 2012, 194). In Deegan-Krause’s words, Mečiar’s success was based on his “ability to sustain the image of an underdog fighting against a unified elite even while he exercised the full power of the state” (Deegan-Krause 2012, 187) (OTH_POLCLASS = 3). According to a number of other sources, the party’s anti-elite populist rhetoric declined after the 1998 election, at which point it tried to portray itself as a “normal party” (Deegan-Krause and Haughton 2009, 831; Stanley 2017, 50). For this reason, we’ve included it in the dataset only up to this election.\nMost sources suggest that Mečiar embraced a form of Slovak nationalism that defined the people and their “others” in ethnic terms (Scheiring 2021, 1588; Deegan-Krause 2012, 186). This involved the frequent scapegoating of the large Hungarian minority (Stanley 2011, 258–59; Abrahám 1995, 97). In 1994, for example, HZDS campaign leaflets asserted: “Who does not vote for HZDS is voting for Hungarian autonomy” (Haughton 2001, 752). The HZDS’s ethnocentrism also targeted the Slovakian Roma population. One HZDS minister told a rally in 1995 that the government would ensure that the Roma birth rate is lower than that of the white population (Haughton 2001, 753). On both fronts it appears that the HZDS’s rhetoric has been somewhat softer than other parties (notably the SNS) (Abrahám 1995, 97). Nonetheless, there is sufficient evidence to code it 3 on OTH_ETHNIC in the years in which it features in the dataset. We’ve found no evidence that opposition to immigrants featured prominently in the party’s appeal (perhaps in part due to the low immigration rate in the 1990s) (OTH_IMMIGRANTS = 1).\nIn line with his nationalistic ideology, Mečiar’s opposition to the domestic political elite and ethnic minorities tied into a general claim that these enemies of the nation represented foreign powers, such that the true “elite” was elsewhere (Deegan-Krause 2012, 188; Deegan-Krause and Haughton 2009, 831). The Hungarian minority was thus linked to Hungarian meddling, as Roma were linked to the influence of the European Union (Deegan-Krause 2012, 186). The United States and the Czech Republic were also linked to domestic rivals in this way (Deegan-Krause 2012, 188) (OTH_FOREIGN = 3). We’ve seen no evidence of any OTH_MILITARY (= 1) or OTH_FINANCIAL (= 1) rhetoric.\nHZDS’s ideology is generally considered nationalist, (Deegan-Krause 2012; Kim 2021, 224; Menzies 2004; Carpenter 1997), although it also contained a number of economically centrist, centre-left, or just “hazy” policy approaches that make the party difficult to categorise on the left-right spectrum (Haughton 2001, 763; Bútora and Bútorová 1993, 81). Throughout much of the 1990s it was considered “centrist” (Ferencei 2020, 168). Most sources claim that the party’s cultural nationalism was its most salient ideological element (Kim 2021, 224), and therefore we’ve coded it CR on LRPOSITION.\nMečiar has been considered a charismatic (Abrahám 1995, 89) and demagogic (Carpenter 1997, 212) figure, and many analysts have contended that the party’s appeal was meaningless but for its association with his personality (Haughton 2001, 748; 2003a, 269; Haughton and Rybář 2008, 242). Mečiar himself said “the strongest stream in the HZDS am I” (Van Duin and ková 2000, 342). According to Menzies,\n\nThe ideology of the movement was not sufficient to hold together a movement full of ambiguities and contradictions. From the very beginning, Vladimir Mečiar had been crucial in holding all these interests and beliefs together. That continued to be the case and so the HZDS must be seen as an example of a charismatic party (Menzies 2004, 65).\n\nStructurally, while the party possessed a relatively robust party organisation (Deegan-Krause and Haughton 2009, 831), over time it came to be totally dominated by Mečiar (Deegan-Krause 2012, 195) (Haughton 2001, 754). As a consequence many in the literature have considered the party a “charismatic party” (Haughton 2001, 755) or at least a “leader-oriented political movement” (Ferencei 2020, 167) (CHARISMA = 3).\nOwing to his time in government in the 1990s, Mečiar has been consistently considered as hostile to liberal democratic norms in Slovakia, with some analysts claiming that he “derailed” the transition to liberal democratic government altogether (Stanley 2011, 258), and embraced an “authoritarian” model (especially after 1994) (Kim 2021, 233). Regarding Slovakia’s democratic institutions, the HZDS government purged the state bureaucracy and intelligence services of non-allied employees (Bútora and Bútorová 1993, 81; Carpenter 1997, 215–16; Ferencei 2020, 168), kicked the opposition off powerful committees in parliament and other oversight institutions (Deegan-Krause 2012, 194; Żarna 2018, 105), called the Constitutional Course a “diseased element” (Ferencei 2020, 168), and sought to weaken the power of the president (Ferencei 2020, 168; Deegan-Krause 2012, 194). The government also curtailed the freedom of the press by shutting down opposition newspapers (Bútora and Bútorová 1993, 81; Abrahám 1995, 5), placing party members in charge of media regulation (Kim 2021, 233), and firing the political editor of a television broadcaster due to “biased coverage,” leading to the cancelling of all government-critical programming (Carpenter 1997, 215–16). Mečiar was also allegedly engaged in a plot to kidnap the son of president Michal Kováč’s (Carpenter 1997, 216; Haughton 2003b, 67). This is sufficient to code the party 3 on LIBDEMNORMS. Given that the party emerged out of the existing government within Slovakia (before the split with the Czech Republic), we’ve coded it 3 on INSIDER."

    "text": "Slovak National Party\nThe Slovak National Party (Slovenská národná strana, SNS), was founded in 1990, at which point it was organised primarily around the demand for independence from the Czechoslovak union (Pytlas 2013, 168). The party claimed successorship to the original SNS active between 1870 and 1938 (Walter 2017, 176). Though the party was regarded by some as an “extreme nationalist party” from its foundation in 1990 (see Żarna 2018, 74), others claim that under the leadership of Ľudovit Černák it espoused more of a “liberal conservative pragmatism” in its early years (Haughton, Rybář, and Deegan-Krause 2021, 331), and only turned to a radical ethno-nationalism and anti-establishment populism after the Velvet Divorce from Czechia and under the new leadership of Ján Slota from 1994 (Pytlas 2013, 168; Kevický 2022, 6). On the balance of evidence we’ve decided not to include the party in the dataset until its first election under Slota’s leadership in 1994. Under Slota the party polled 5.4% in the 1994 elections and gained 9 seats, forming a coalition government with HZDS and ZRS until 1998. The party split in 2002 when Anna Malikova took the leadership from Slota, who went on to found the Real Slovak National Party in protest (Haughton 2003b, 82). Both entities fared poorly and reunited under Slota’s leadership before the 2006 election, in which it won 11.7% and entered a coalition with Smer. It’s vote then declined and it failed to make the 5% threshold to enter Parliament in 2012, leading Slota to step down. His replacement Andrej Danko the party condemned Slota’s leadership and expelled him from the party (Rybář and Spáč 2017, 154), and made other changes to abandon radical nationalism and extremism (Školkay 2021, 11; Struhár 2016, 27) such that “the party may be considered a traditional right-wing party” from this point on (Karabová and Filipec 2018, 6). We have therefore not included the party in the dataset under Danko’s leadership.\nSlota and the SNS engaged in “populist anti-establishment rhetoric” (Pytlas 2013, 168) against the Slovak political elite whom it accused of “extreme cosmopolitanism” (Żarna 2018, 111) and opposition to the Slovak nation (Ferencei 2020, 168). However, there is not a lot of discussion in the literature about the specifically anti-establishment elements of the party’s rhetoric, and Engler et al (Engler, Pytlas, and Deegan-Krause 2019, 1326) claim that the party’s anti-establishment rhetoric was notably lower than other populist parties in the region. More evidence would be useful here on the specific nature of the claims, but this does appear to be sufficient to code the party 2 for OTH_POLCLASS under Slota.\nThe principle framework of the SNS was ethnonationalism, which was targeted to appeal to ethnic Slovaks (Deegan-Krause and Haughton 2009, 829), and made “others” of both ethnic Hungarians and Roma (Haughton 2003b, 82; Haughton, Rybář, and Deegan-Krause 2021, 331; Lang 2005, 9). Its 2006 campaign slogan, for example, was “Let’s return Slovakia into the hands of Slovaks!” (Haughton and Rybář 2008, 241). It was initially the Hungarian minority whom the party focused on most, accusing it of national disloyalty (Stanley 2011, 258–59), comprising of a great evil (Deegan-Krause and Haughton 2009, 831), and seeing Slovakia as merely a Felvidék (“upperlands”) of the Hungarian state to which it should return (Pytlas 2013, 173). Slota said in 1994, for example that “the Hungarian [minority] political subjects should be outlawed because their true and direct objective is the destruction of the Slovak Republic as a state” (Carpenter 1997, 215). The party also targeted Roma as “parasites” underserving of social support (Ferencei 2020, 169) and alleged that the “Gypsy problem” (a pejorative term) could only be solved by extreme policies like confiscating children from “maladjusted parents” (Struhár 2016, 27), or, in more violent terms, with “long whip and a small yard” (Haughton 2001, 753). This is clearly deserving of a 3 on OTH_ETHNIC. Throughout the 1990s immigration was not on the party’s radar at all, but this changed as the party developed an anti-immigration stance after about 2005 (Stefancik, Némethová, and Seresová 2021, 732) (OTH_IMMIGRANTS = 1 1994-1998, 3 2006-2012).\nSlota and the SNS exuded OTH_FOREIGN rhetoric, primarily against neighbouring Hungary but also against NATO (Evans and Whitefield 1998, 121; Żarna 2018, 111). However as this did not rise to the level of alleging that the political elite was wholly controlled by foreign powers (although it did think this about the ethnic Hungarian parties in Slovakia), we’ve coded it 2 on OTH_FOREIGN. We’ve seen no evidence for anything on the OTH_FINANCIAL or OTH_MILITARY variables (= 0).\nThe party is considered “far-right” by most scholars (Struhár 2016, 27; Stojarová 2018, 38), and ideologically nationalist and conservative (Sekerák 2019, 237). In its economic policy it has been considered either centrist (Hloušek and Kopeček 2008, 543–44) or right of centre (Pinterič and Žúborová 2014, 360), and at the time of its foundation it advocated for pro-market reforms (Barański 2020, 38). However its economic policy were “not important parts of the party’s platform” (Hloušek and Kopeček 2008, 543–44), and on the basis of its evident ethno-nationalism we’ve coded it FR. While the SNS was a highly leader-centric structure and communication strategy (Haughton, Rybář, and Deegan-Krause 2021, 334), and was clearly attached to Slota’s “boorish behaviour” under his leadership (Haughton, Rybář, and Deegan-Krause 2021, 331; Učeň and Gyárfášová 2021, 289), it also had a relatively strong base that evidently withstood a number of leadership changes since its creation (Rybář and Spáč 2020, 643–44). We’ve therefore coded it 2 on CHARISMA.\nThe SNS is somewhat difficult on the subject of liberal democratic norms. The best reason to code it above 1 on this register is its occasional celebration of the fascist World War II era Sovak President Jozef Tiso (Slota proposed a commemorative plaque to Tiso in 2000, Haughton 2001, 752). Aside from that, Slota has used violent language in is solutions to Roma related problems (see above) (Haughton 2001, 753). On more philosophical grounds, Abrahám claims that the SNS was hostile to the principle of individual human rights (Abrahám 1995, 98). While this is grounds to elevate the party beyond 1, we’ve not seen a lot of evidence of other violations of liberal democratic norms such as actual practices of violence or hostility to electoral or judicial democratic institutions that would put it on per with other parties coded 3, and hence we’ve coded the SNS 2 on LIBDEMNORMS for its time in the dataset. Due to the SNS’s role in the coalition government after the 1994 election, we’ve coded it 2 on INSIDER from 1998 onward."

    "text": "The Slovak Workers’ Association\nThe Slovak Workers’ Association (Združenie robotníkov Slovenska, ZRS) was a left-wing party created by a former Party of the Democratic Left (SDL) MP Ján Ľupták. Ľupták formed the ZRS (first as a civic organisation in 1992 and then as a party in 1994) due to his frustration with the SDL’s failure to represent the interests of working people (Haughton 2004, 186). The party took an impressive 7.3% in the 1994 elections, where it campaigned as an “unpredictable” protest party (Abrahám 1995, 89). After that election it became a coalition partner of the HZDS and SNS in government until 1998. Voters abandoned the party in droves after this, in part due to the fact that Ľupták had promised not to join any government (Wightman and Szomolänyi 1995, 613), and it won only 1.3% in 1998. According to a number of sources, the party’s time in government dampened its anti-establishment themes (Spáč 2012, 244; Stanley 2017), and it “lost its distinctive voice and its ability to express anti-elite grievances” (Deegan-Krause and Haughton 2009, 830).\nAppealing to the losers of Slovakia’s transition to a market system (Żarna 2018, 105), Ľupták and the ZRS crafted broad critique of the entirety of the political class (Deegan-Krause 2007, 6), which it accused of pursuing its own interests at the expense of ordinary people (Stanley 2017). Corruption allegations against the political establishment focused specifically on the sale of state assets (Abrahám 1995, 90; Ferencei 2020, 170). In Spáč’s words:\n\nIt defined itself as a politically and morally clean party with the goal of unifying the broader segments of society. The existing establishment was accused by the party of being egoistical and placing its own goals above general national and civic interest… From the beginning Ľupták’s party positioned itself to exploit the tension between society and the elites, with society being seen as morally good, the elites as a stratum that had betrayed its trust. (Spáč 2012, 243)\n\nĽupták articulated this “anti-establishment” (Školkay and Žúborová 2019, 7) politics in a “demagogic” style (Żarna 2018, 105), at one point demanding the “resignation of all deputies who have publicly humiliated workers” (Ulč 1996, 348). On this evidence we’ve coded the party 3 on OTH_POLCLASS.\nAside from the political class, the ZRS focused attacks on the emerging economic elite that benefited from state privatisations (Nemčok and Spáč 2019, 767; Abrahám 1995, 90). According to Ulč, Ľupták was “an advocate of class hatred” who claimed that he could “respect only those people who built a house with their own hands” (Ulč 1996, 348) (OTH_FINANCIAL = 3). He was also critical of NATO, the EU and IMF (Bútora 1994, 53), and alleged that the west would convert Slovakia into its colony (Ulč 1996, 348). However we’ve not seen evidence that this related in any way to the party’s domestic rivals, so we’ve labelled it 1 on OTH_FOREIGN. We’ve seen no evidence of any discourse on the OTH_ETHNIC, OTH_IMMIGRANT, or OTH_MILITARY variables (all = 1).\nThe literature considers the party “extreme left” (Wightman and Szomolänyi 1995, 612), “far left” (Nemčok and Spáč 2019, 760), “radical left” (Hloušek and Kopeček 2008, 537; Stanley 2017) “ultra leftist” (Ulč 1996, 348), or variations, owing to its clear opposition to market reforms and privatisations (Nemčok and Spáč 2019, 761). We see no reason to dispute this, and have coded it FL on LRPOSITION. The party had a strong membership and ideological base, but was clearly centralised around Ľupták in both organisation and image (Spáč 2012, 240). Some scholars attribute a portion of the party’s 1994 success to Ľupták personal popularity (Haughton 2004, 186) (CHARISMA = 3). The closest evidence we’ve found of violations of liberal democratic norms are Ľupták’s general criticisms of journalists (Carpenter 1997, 215), but this is insufficient to be coded above 1 on LIBDEMNORMS. Ľupták did not serve in government before 1994 (INSIDER = 1)."

    "text": "Smer-SD\nSmer (meaning “direction”) was created by former SDL MP Robert Fico soon after the 1998 election (Spáč and Havlík 2015, 5). It placed third in 2002 and continually increased its vote in successive elections, forming a coalition government with the smaller HZDS and SNS in 2006, before going back into opposition in 2010, and returning to government outright in 2012. From 2006 onward, the party added the words “Social Democracy” to its name (“Smer-SD”). After dominating Slovak politics for over a decade, Fico was forced to resign in 2018 in the wake of mass protests following the death of a journalist who had uncovered corruption in his government (Weyland 2022, 26). After an initial non-ideological stance, by 2006 the party adopted a clear left-wing position and focused on socioeconomic issues in critique of the Dzurinda government’s liberal reforms (Hloušek and Kopeček 2008, 539), after which it moved into a more ethno-centric nationalism while in government. Smer’s vote declined to 18% in the 2020 election under Fico’s successor Peter Pellegrini. Smer supported the candidacy of incumbent President Ivan Gašparovič in the 2009 presidential election. However Gašparovič was an independent, and never belonged to Smer, hence we have not included that election in the dataset. Fico ran as Smer’s candidate in the following 2014 election, which we have included. He lost in the second round to independent Anrej Kiska with 40.6%.\nThere is no doubt that Fico and Smer were populist actors in the 2002 election, where it was “an avowedly anti-elite force” (Stanley 2011, 260), exercising “vitriolic personal attacks” on the incumbent government and established parties (Haughton 2003b, 78; Spáč 2012, 236–37). This campaign considered the political elite to be fundamental estranged from ordinary people, the latter having been “abandoned and mistreated by the elite” (Stanley 2017). In Kim’s words “In his creation of the ‘politicians’ as an antagonist, he merged the current and former governments ‘part of the same corrupt power bloc that has alternated in government and failed’” (Kim 2021, 241). As this implies, Fico did not consider differences within the elite to be any more than superficial, as all politicians were equally corrupt (Učeň 2007, 55; Deegan-Krause and Haughton 2009, 830). He also considered this elite to be fundamentally self-serving, deliberately placing their own interests before those of the ordinary people (Učeň 2004, 55; Kim 2021, 240; Spáč and Havlík 2015, 6). This was well-captured by the party’s iconic slogan from 2012: “as they stole under Mečiar, so they steal under Dzurinda” (Spáč 2012, 245). However the party is somewhat more difficult to classify from the 2006 election onward. Aside from its ideological shift toward the left (see below), several sources claim that Fico and Smer toned down personal attacks in the 2006 campaign (Haughton and Rybář 2008, 240), and even departed from a populist tone altogether (Stanley 2017, 247), especially after it was in power after 2006 (Spáč and Havlík 2015, 8; Školkay 2021, 7; Frič and Gyárfášová 2019, 237). However many of these claims appear to be linked to the fact that Smer moved its ideological profile from a “pure” populist force to a social-democratic one by 2006 (which doesn’t’ disqualify or alter their anti-political class populism by our definition), and other sources claim that Fico maintained a populist discursive stance after Smer’s post-2002 shift (Učeň, Gyárfášová, and Krivý 2005, 44), and continued to do so while in government (Deegan-Krause 2012, 197; Školkay 2021, 7). For these reasons we’ve coded SMER 3 on OTH_POLCLASS in 2002 but reduced this to 2 from 2006 onward.\nFico and Smer have repeatedly supplemented their anti-elite populist with a kind of “light” ethnonationalism (Stojarová 2018, 38) against minorities and immigrants. The targeting of ethnic Hungarians and Roma was present in 2002 (Haughton 2003b, 77; Mesežnikov 2008, 10; Rybář and Spáč 2017, 154). In 2001 Fico alleged that the incumbent Dzurinda government “assists Hungarians in their step-by-step coordinated endeavor aimed at strengthening their position in Southern Slovakia from the inside as well as from the outside” (Mesežnikov 2008, 20). He has also criticised the “irresponsible growth irresponsible growth of the Roma population” (Spáč and Havlík 2015, 6). Unlike the SNS, these appear to be “forays” into ethno-centric rhetoric rather than core pillars (Haughton 2003b, 77), and hence we’ve coded the party 2 on OTH_ETHNIC. In the context of the 2015 refugee crisis, anti-immigration rhetoric – specifically he labelling of migrants as an economically motivated security threat – “dominated” Smer’s 2016 campaign (Rybář and Spáč 2017, 154; see also Gyárfášová and Hlatky 2023, 4). We’ve therefore coded Smer 3 on OTH_IMMIGRANT from 2016 onward. Given that Fico’s anti-Hungarian rhetoric was targeted at both the ethnic Hungarians living in Slovakia and the Hungarian state (Mesežnikov 2008), we’ve coded Smer 2 on OTH_FOREIGN. Interestingly, though the party adopted a left leaning economic policy alongside its anti-elite populism from 2006, we’ve not seen any evidence that economic elites or businesses were targeted as “others” of the ordinary people in Smer’s populist rhetoric. In fact, according to Učeň (Učeň 2007, 56) Fico expressed an admiration for private sector management, which he advocated for the state (OTH_FINANCIAL = 1). We have also found no reference to the military (OTH_MILITARY = 1).\nSmer’s ideological profile has been the subject of much discussion in the literature. At its formation Fico positioned the party in a post-ideological “third way” space that espoused “common sense” over the ideologies of other parties (Kim 2021, 240–41; Spáč and Havlík 2015, 2; Gyárfášová and Hlatky 2023, 4). Smer however is and always was a somewhat nationalist party (Walter 2017, 176; Mesežnikov 2008; Gyárfášová 2008), and one with a streak of conservative stances on social and cultural issues (Gyárfášová and Hlatky 2023, 4). On the balance of evidence it doesn’t appear that these are quite salient enough to consider it a fundamentally right leaning party, and hence the vast majority of the literature considers Smer to be left-wing from 2006 onward (Stojarová 2018, 38; Hloušek and Kopeček 2008, 543; Gyárfášová and Hlatky 2023, 4). From the available evidence it seems that its’ socio-economic policy was relatively mild (see Lang 2005, 11; Učeň 2007, 58), and hence we’ve coded it CL on LRPOSITION from 2006 onward, and C in 2002\nThe literature clearly sees Fico as a dominant figure in the public images and internal organisation of Smer (Gyárfášová and Hlatky 2023, 4; Deegan-Krause and Haughton 2009, 831; Gyárfášová and Hlatky 2023, 4; Haughton 2003b, 77; Haughton, Novotná, and Deegan-Krause 2011, 397; Marušiak 2017, 185). In the words of Spáč and Havlík, “The party was created as a sole act of its founder Robert Fico what was reflected in its internal framework and processes. The original ‘structure’ of SMER consisted only of chairman, general manager and a central executive committee, however overshadowed by the party leader” (Spáč and Havlík 2015, 8) (CHARISMA = 3 2002-2016). This is more difficult to assess under Pellegrini during the 2020 election, given that Fico remained the party leader while Pellegrini was Prime Minister (Marušiak 2021). Even with this shift, Fico played a “supportive role” (Haughton, Rybář, and Deegan-Krause 2022, 742), and we’ve considered it hard to pain the party as either 1 or 3 on CHARISMA in 2020 for this reason (= 2).\nThere are a number of reasons to claim that Fico and Smer threatened liberal democratic norms in Slovakia, including their attacks on the judiciary and open hostility to the media government (Stanley 2011, 259–60). However, in Deegan-Krause’s words,\n\nFico’s populism did not coincide with a significant erosion of democracy. It is true that the Fico government interfered with the independence of the judiciary, imposed restrictions on the use of the Hungarian language, and exhibited significant corruption. But unlike Mečiar Fico did not pose a fundamental threat to Slovakia’s basic democratic institutions (Deegan-Krause 2012, 197)\n\nOn this evidence we’ve coded Smer 2 on LIBDEMNORMS for its duration in the dataset. We’ve also coded it 3 on INSIDER from 2010 on, after Fico’s first stint as Prime Minister 2009-2010 (note that Pellegrini was incumbent Prime Minister in 2020)."

    "text": "Ordinary People and Independent Personalities\nOrdinary People and Independent Personalities (Obyčajní ľudia a nezávislé osobnosti, OĽaNO) started off as civic association founded by media mogul Igor Matovič that entered parliament in 2010 as a faction of the Freedom and Solidarity (SaS) party (which we do not consider populist – see below). The group soon fell out with the SaS leadership (which was part of the governing coalition) and registered as an independent political party in late 2011. In the next two elections (2012 & 2016) OĽaNO polled third place with 8.6% and 11% respectively. As Matovič built a reputation as a flamboyant and effective anti-corruption campaigner (Kazharski and Makarychev 2020, 183), OĽaNO benefited most from the decline of Fico and Smer from 2018. In the 2020 election its vote rose to 25%, and Matovič became Prime Minister in a coalition government with three smaller parties.\nOĽaNO is frequently described as an “anti-establishment” party (Rybář and Spáč 2017, 153; Engler, Pytlas, and Deegan-Krause 2019, 1322; Kohutova and Horvat 2018, 21; Marušiak 2017, 192) and a “protest movement” (Buzalka 2021, 1664; Školkay 2021, 12) with an “anti-party” character (Kim 2021, 223; Rybář and Spáč 2020, 646; Hloušek, Kopeček, and Vodová 2020, 103). The driving force behind its anti-establishment narrative was its anti-corruption motif, which took the place of any binding ideological agenda (Kazharski and Makarychev 2020, 182; Stojarová 2018, 37). In contrast to the “evil” ways of its established rivals (Hloušek, Kopeček, and Vodová 2020, 104), OĽaNO has, according to Gyárfášová and Hlatky, “dedicated itself to being perceived as a direct antithesis to political parties and establishment politics” (Gyárfášová and Hlatky 2023, 4). A key element of this has been Matovič’s elaborate and performative style (Kazharski and Makarychev 2020, 181), which have involved numerous publicity seeking stunts and crude language (Haughton, Rybář, and Deegan-Krause 2022, 737). For example, he once emptied a bag of fake banknotes in parliament to protest alleged corruption (Kazharski and Makarychev 2020, 183). Built into this anti-establishment narrative was the assertion that politicians were essentially a homogenous class opposed pitted against ordinary people (Engler, Pytlas, and Deegan-Krause 2019, 1323–24), and one whose main crime was being “thieves” (Kohutova and Horvat 2018, 15): in one of its manifestos, for example, it pledged that “property stolen by politicians we will return to the people” (Haughton, Rybář, and Deegan-Krause 2022, 739; see also Viera 2015, 105). This is clearly enough evidence to code the party 3 on OTH_POLCLASS.\nBeyond its hostility toward the political class, OĽaNO did not exibit much rhetorical opposition to many other “Other” groups (Školkay 2021, 12). Matovič presented policies aimed at integration of Roma and criticised the media for stereotypes in coverage of Roma issues (Kohutova and Horvat 2018, 21). He also made a point of reminding voters that one of OĽaNO’s candidates was a Roma, and criticised the “fascism” of the ĽSNS (Hloušek, Kopeček, and Vodová 2020, 108). We’ve seen no evidence of other ethnocentric “othering” (OTH_ETHNIC = 1). The party also did not engage in the anti-migrant politics of the 2015 crisis, and were generally open to integrating migrants into society (Kohutova and Horvat 2018, 19) (OTH_IMMIGRANTS = 1). Matovič considered Russia to be the primary external threat to Slovakia (Kohutova and Horvat 2018, 21), but not to the degree that would be considered on the OTH_FOREIGN scale (= 1). We’ve also seen no evidence for OTH_MILITARY (= 1). One exception here is economic elites, given that Matovič repeatedly claimed that Slovakia had degenerated into an “oligarchic state” (Učeň and Gyárfášová 2021, 293), and contrasted OĽaNO to other parties due to the fact that “no oligarch’s stand behind us” (Učeň and Gyárfášová 2021, 293). This however doesn’t appear to have been as salient a part of the party’s rhetoric as its opposition to political elites, and we’ve coded OĽaNO 2 for OTH_FINANCIAL.\nThe initial literature on OĽaNO universally considers it to be a non-ideological party (Rybář and Spáč 2020, 651; Kohutova and Horvat 2018, 14), and lacking in any clear policy agenda or program (Mihálik 2017, 13; Stojarová 2018, 37; Engler, Pytlas, and Deegan-Krause 2019, 1322). More recent sources claim that OĽaNO was “conservative” (Kim 2021, 223), this appears to relate more to the recruitment of Christian and nationalist MPs into its ranks before the 2020 election (Buzalka 2021, 1658). These however appear to be factions among others (Just 2022, 167), and there appears to be nothing in Matovič’s or OĽaNO’s own stances that are notably right of centre, and hence we’ve coded it C on LRPOSITION.\nAll sources on OĽaNO state that Matovič’s image dominated the party’s brand. Specifically, his “unconventional” (Gyárfášová and Hlatky 2023, 4) “unrestrained” (Kazharski and Makarychev 2020, 182), and “demagogic” (Buzalka 2021, 1664) behaviour personified the party’s image. In Hloušek, Kopeček, and Vodová’s words: “Matovič displayed an attractive style of performance based on emotion and provocation. This political entrepreneur offered no technocratic-managerial vision, but a radical, uninhibited political performance” (Hloušek, Kopeček, and Vodová 2020, 101). Structurally, the party has had no real membership base of organisation beneath Matovič (Školkay 2021, 13), and it has been called an “owner party” (Marušiak 2017, 193), a “personalist” party (Weyland 2022, 37), and a “one man show” (Hloušek, Kopeček, and Vodová 2020). This means that Matovič has been unrivalled within the party for leadership (Rybář and Spáč 2020, 646). (CHARISMA = 3). We’ve seen no evidence that OĽaNO as violated liberal democratic norms (on the contrary, OĽaNO made point of distancing itself from anti-democratic nature of more extreme populist parties, see: Kohutova and Horvat 2018, 23). Given that Matovič and was briefly a member of the governing coalition 2010-12, we’ve coded OĽaNO 2 on INSIDER for each subsequent election."

    "text": "People's Party - Our Slovakia (L’SNS)\nPeople’s Party – Our Slovakia (Ľudová Strana Naše Slovensko, ĽSNS) formed as a political party in 2010 under the leadership of Marian Kotleba, a far right activist with a history of membership in neo-Nazi movements (Harris 2019, 540). The party made breakthrough in 2016 on the back of the 2015 migrant crisis (Kazharski and Makarychev 2020, 177), when its vote escalated to 8% and it won 14 seats in parliament. It maintained this level of support in 2020, though soon afterward Kotleba was convicted of extremism and the party fell into disarray (Kevický 2022, 7).\nThe ĽSNS has consistently represented the political elite as a corrupt “system” distinct from the “decent people” (Kazharski and Makarychev 2020, 180; see also Mihálik 2017; Struhár 2016, 28; Harris 2019, 541; Cirner and Dudinská 2020, 185), and on this basis it has frequently been considered anti-establishment (Engler, Pytlas, and Deegan-Krause 2019, 1323) and anti-elitist (Just 2022, 163) in the literature. Its central campaign slogan in 2016, for example was “With Courage Against the System” (Filipec 2017, 24). The party considered the political elite to be essentially homogenous (Drábik 2022, 426) and to have “betrayed” the people (Stefancik, Némethová, and Seresová 2021, 739; Mihálik 2017, 13), by deliberately serving its own interests at the expense of the people (Řádek 2019, 47). Its campaigns claimed therefore that it was “trying to prevent further theft of Slovakia by politicians and parasites” (Řádek 2019, 48) (OTH_POLCLASS = 3).\nĽSNS was a fundamentally ethnonationalist party (Kim 2021, 223) that viewed the people and their “others” in largely racial and ethnic terms (Kazharski and Makarychev 2020, 180; Filipec 2017, 25). Its original target for this rhetoric were Roma (Drábik 2022, 422; Kazharski 2019, 1), whom the party called “social parasites” (Struhár 2016, 28) and practitioners of “Gypsy extremism” (Kazharski 2019, 1), who should be subjected to “discipline” (Škobla and Filčák 2020, 786–87) or even “cleansing” (Buzalka 2021, 1669). The party has also consistently espoused anti-Semitism (Just 2022, 163; Harris 2019, 542; Kazharski 2019, 7), and since the migrant crisis has developed discourse harshly critical of “inhuman” Islam (Kevický 2022, 7), and “violent Africans, Turks and Asians” (Stefancik, Némethová, and Seresová 2021, 738) (OTH_ETHNIC = 3). ĽSNS has discussed the threat of immigration as “occupation” (Filipec 2017, 25), or potentially “national suicide” (Stojarová 2018, 36). One campaign document said that “Europe is inundated by an invasion of dangerous immigrants from Africa and Asia. They attack, rob, rape and murder the indigenous people of European countries every day” (Drábik 2022, 426) (OTH_IMMIGRANT = 3).\nAlongside its ethno-nationalism, ĽSNS considered economic elites inside and outside of the country to be an enemy of the people (Filipec 2017, 24; Buzalka 2021, 1669). The party’s campaign discourse repeatedly considered “oligarch’s” as a part of the “system” (Kazharski 2019, 8) who had “stolen” businesses in the privatisation process (Řádek 2019, 49). For example, one billboard stated “We will take from the oligarchs and mafia and give to mothers, fathers, and pensioners!” (Buzalka 2021, 1671). Though perhaps not as salient as the party’s opposition to ethnic others and immigrants, this appears to be strong enough to code the party 3 on OTH_FINANCIAL. Another aspect of the party’s populism is its opposition to Western foreign forces (Mesežnikov and Gyárfášová 2018, 85), whom it accuses of attempting to control and subordinate Slovakia. It has called NATO a terrorist organisation (Řádek 2019, 48) and a “criminal pact” (Filipec 2017, 24–25), and considered Slovakia’s membership in the EU akin to colonisation (Kazharski 2019, 8) due to the latter’s plan to “destroy us not only economically but also socially” (Stefancik, Némethová, and Seresová 2021, 739; see also Kazharski 2019, 8; Buzalka 2021, 1671). It also considered the political class to be controlled by outside forces such as, Zionists and international financiers, who insert multiculturalism as part of a plot to replace nation states with a single world government (see Kazharski 2019, 7–8; Řádek 2019, 48) (OTH_FOREIGN = 3). We’ve seen no evidence of OTH_MILITARY discourse (= 1).\nOwing to the salience of ethno-nationalism in its ideological outlook, ĽSNS has been universally classed as a “far right” (Stojarová 2018, 38), or “neo-fascist” (Haughton, Rybář, and Deegan-Krause 2021, 331; Cirner and Dudinská 2020; Gyárfášová and Hlatky 2023, 4; Frič and Gyárfášová 2019, 238), and “neo-Nazi” (Drábik 2022, 417) party. While its economic program was clearly redistributionist, these or any other conventional policy issues were barely mentioned in its campaign materials (Drábik 2022, 424) (LRPOSITION = FR). There is relatively little written about the position of Kotleba in the party, but he has clearly played a dominant role it its functioning and representation (Gyárfášová and Hlatky 2023, 4). The party also added the name “Kotleba” to its official title in 2015 to indicate this. While there is a case that the ĽSNS’s populism is less leader-centric than other parties, given Kotleba’s position in and control of the party we’ve coded it 3 on CHARISMA.\nAccording to numerous analysts, in words and actions ĽSNS has mounted a “denial of the fundamental principles and values of liberal democracy” (Frič and Gyárfášová 2019, 238; see also Kazharski 2019, 2; Harris 2019, 538). The most notorious examples of this are the party’s use of uniformed “security patrols” on trains (Harris 2019, 542; Kazharski and Makarychev 2020, 179), protecting “decent” people from “Gypsy extremists” (Struhár 2016, 28). According to Kazharski and Makarychev, these guards deliberately wore uniforms similar to those of the nationalist militia active in Slovakia during the fascist wartime regime of Josef Tiso (Kazharski and Makarychev 2020, 179). The party has also pledged its affinity to the Tiso regime by parroting its slogans (Harris 2019, 538). As the party has never been a member of a governing coalition, we’ve coded it 1 on INSIDER."

    "text": "We Are Family/Sme Rodina\nWe Are Family (Sme Rodina, SR) was created by Boris Kollár, a controversial businessman with a “tabloid celebrity profile” in 2015 (Frič and Gyárfášová 2019, 238). It won 6.6% of the vote in the subsequent 2016 elections, which increased to 8.24 in 2020. Kollár and SR maintained an anti-establishment (Rybář and Spáč 2017, 155) and anti-elite narrative that emphasised the untrustworthiness of the political system (Mihálik 2017, 17), which he accused of endemic corruption (Školkay and Žúborová 2019, 8; Stojarová 2018, 38). SR conceived of politicians as a distinct and unified class who stood against the ordinary people’s interests, as is well-captured in its most memorable slogan form 2016: “I don’t vote for politicians, I vote for Boris” (Marušiak 2017, 193) (OTH_POLCLASS = 3).\nAside from its antagonism to the political elite, SR’s main campaign issue was its opposition to immigrants (Školkay and Žúborová 2019, 8), particularly Muslims, whom the party considered a danger to “our culture, religion and freedom, including our homes and families” (Mihálik 2017, 14; Marušiak 2017, 193). We’ve therefore coded it 3 for both OTH_ETHNIC and OTH_IMMIGRANT. SR was also strongly opposed to the European Union (Stojarová 2018, 38), which Kollár called “Euro-rubbish” and the “Brussels elite” (Školkay and Žúborová 2019, 13–15). While this foreign “other” was clearly an enemy of the people in SR’s rhetoric, it does not seem to be the case that it was considered to control the domestic elite (OTH_FOREIGN = 2). Despite Kollár’s own history as a businessperson, he and SR campaigned against financial interests and “oligarchs” influencing the political system (Mihálik 2017, 14; Stojarová 2018, 38). In one video he accused the political elite of “sponsoring grand capital with cheap labour” (Školkay and Žúborová 2019, 16). We’ve therefore coded SR 3 on OTH_FINANCIAL. We’ve seen no evidence of any opposition to the military (OTH_MILITARY = 1).\nSR is somewhat difficult to define ideologically (Frič and Gyárfášová 2019, 238). On face value, it campaigned without any clear ideology (Mihálik 2017, 13), and Kollár frequently emphasised his aversion to any ideological label (Marušiak 2017, 193). The policies of the party are somewhat eclectic (Školkay and Žúborová 2019, 13). On the one hand its opposition to oligarchs and embrace of support for low-income people (Rybář and Spáč 2017, 155; Engler, Pytlas, and Deegan-Krause 2019, 1324) suggest a left-leaning position. On the other, the party is more frequently associated with the right owing to the centrality of its anti-immigrant nativism (Kim 2021, 223), its social conservativism (Marušiak 2017, 193; Gyárfášová and Hlatky 2023, 4), and its national conservativism (Just 2022, 167). Owing to the perceived salience of the latter issues in its campaigns we’ve coded it R on LRPOSITION, but this could be revisited.\nSR was built around Kollár’s image, to the extent that it has been classed as an “entrepreneurial” party (Frič and Gyárfášová 2019, 238), and an “electoral vehicle” for its leader (Gyárfášová and Hlatky 2023, 4). The literature suggests that the party depended totally on Kollár’s charisma (Marušiak 2017, 193; Učeň and Gyárfášová 2021, 290; Školkay and Žúborová 2019, 8) (CHARISMA = 3). The literature does not suggest that SR threatened liberal democratic norms in Slovakia (Školkay and Žúborová 2019, 16) (LIBDEMNORMS = 1), and Kollár had not featured in government prior to the 2016 or 2020 elections (INSIDER = 1)."

    "text": "Not Included\nThere are several parties that have been occasionally considered populist in the literature which we have not included in the dataset. The Party of Civic Understanding (Strana občianskeho porozumenia, SOP) emerged before the 1998 elections under the leadership of Rudolf Schuster. It also offered a broad critique of the political class (Stanley 2017, 149), due to which it has been considered populist in some of the literature (Učeň 2004, 52; Spáč 2012, 17). However its main criticism of the elite was less about moral failures and more about its inability to work together (Marušiak 2017, 184), and it based its campaigns on the proposition of a “national understanding” to bring all parties together (Učeň, Gyárfášová, and Krivý 2005, 32). Any element of anti-elite populism was also lost after it joined formed the coalition government in 1998 (Deegan-Krause and Haughton 2009, 830–31). On the available evidence we’ve not considered SOP populist by our definition.\nNew Citizens Alliance (ANO) was a personal vehicle of powerful media mogul Pavol Rusko, who launched the party to advocate for liberalisation of the economy before the 2002 elections. ANO has occasionally been considered among populist parties in Slovakia (Učeň 2004, 59–60), owing to what seems to have been a present but quite mild opposition to the political elite (Spáč 2012, 237 (Spáč 2012, 237; Stanley 2017, 149), and its allegation of improper links between politicians and economic elites (Učeň, Gyárfášová, and Krivý 2005, 36). However other scholars have questioned its degree of populism (Kim 2021, 244; Školkay 2021, 11), and according to most literature that we’ve seen there is not quite enough rhetoric in line with our definition to warrant its including in the dataset. For example, according to Učeň, ANO “focused on criticizing incompetence rather than chastising the elite for its moral failings” (Učeň 2004, 59–60).\nFreedom and Solidarity (Sloboda a Solidarita, SaS) was a sort lived anti-immigrant and anti-EU party led by Richard Sulík that has also been included in the broad discussions of Slovak populism. There are some sources that claim SaS practiced an “anti-establishment rhetoric” (Marušiak 2017, 191), but this is not consistent enough in the literature to consider them populist by our standards."

    "text": "The Front National (FN) began in the 1970s as a conglomeration of several right-wing groups. It has gone through several ideological phases, focussing initially on anti-communism (1970s), then opposition to immigration (1980s-) and more recently opposition to globalisation (1990s-) (Hainsworth and Mitchell 2000, 444), and until 2011 was led by Jean-Marie Le Pen. The FN grew steadily through successive legislative and presidential elections, leading up to Le Pen’s break out performance in the 2002 presidential elections, the first in which he made it to the second round (and lost with 17.8%). Le Pen was succeeded by his daughter Marine in 2011, who recorded another second-round presidential appearance in 2017, also losing but with an increased 33.9%.\nIn its criticism of elites and championing of “ordinary folk” (Balent 2013, 177), the party has always anti-elite and anti-establishment motif (Van Kessel 2015, 45; Hainsworth 2004, 107; Rydgren 2008, 166) whom it denigrated with “highly hostile” rhetoric (Eatwell 2002, 14). According to Rydgren, this involved a strategy of depicting “all political parties as constituting a single, homogeneous political class” (Rydgren 2008, 174). Le Pen claimed in 1995 for example that the “rotation [of mainstream left and right parties in the fifth republic] is false, since there are no differences between the two components of French politics” (cited in Rydgren 2008, 177). The party’s core accusation against this political class was both corruption (Hainsworth 2004, 104), and national betrayal (Shields 1995, 24). This anti-establishment attitude was maintained by Marine Le Pen, whose campaigns considered established parties “crooked” (Stockemer and Barisione 2017, 104). We’ve therefore coded FN 3 for OTH_POLCLASS.\nHowever the central ideological principle of the party has always been its OTH_IMMIGRANT and OTH_ETHNIC focus (Marcus 1995; Hainsworth and Mitchell 2000, 444; Rydgren 2008, 168). Its “national preference” policy explicitly advocated supporting French nationals over people from other backgrounds (even those with legal residency) in state programmes (Hainsworth 2004, 106; Hainsworth and Mitchell 2000, 106). This reflected that party’s ethno-nationalist ideas about the French nation being under siege from Third World migrant cultures and transnational affinities and structures like globalisation, the European Union and Islam (Balent 2013, 165; Hainsworth and Mitchell 2000, 445; Eatwell 2002, 12). On both variables, while there is a difference between the radical proposals of the 1980s and the somewhat more moderate approaches of recent years (Hainsworth 2004, 106), this should not see the party decline from a 3 in both.\nMore complicated are the OTH_FINANCIAL and OTH_FOREIGN variables. In economic policy, the party originally claimed a neoliberal identity in the 1970s and 1980s, advocating privatisations, lower taxes and free-marketism (Bastow 1997, 64). While it did possess a general suspicion of big business common on the far right (Bastow 1997; Hainsworth and Mitchell 2000, 446) at this time, We’ve not seen evidence that financial elites themselves were an “other” to the party’s conception of ordinary people. The FN’s economic policy began to veer toward protectionism in the 1990s, which was bound with its opposition to globalisation, and came in the form of opposing free trade and “multinationals” (Bastow 1997, 65). According to Rydgren, (Rydgren 2008, 170), multinational corporations became a target of the party’s populist rhetoric. The work of Ivaldi (Ivaldi 2015, 358–60) in particular shows how more leftward economic policy has become increasingly important to the FN search for working class voters, particularly in the post-GFC period, as (under Marine) the party portrayed the elite in economic terms. It does not appear that this has ever reached a 3 on the OTH_FIANNCIAL scale, as the party has still prioritised the cultural and ethnic dimensions of populism (Balent 2013, 163). We’ve increased this from 1 to 2 in 2012, further research should confirm the timing and degree of this.\nWhile the party’s direct focus on globalisation dates to the 1990s, its OTH_FOREIGN populism has always been strong, initially with the elder Le Pen’s hostility to the United States, NATO, and the WTO (Hainsworth 2004, 107). In 2001, for example, Jean-Marie claimed that France was becoming an “American protectorate” (Hainsworth 2004, 107). Like many far-right parties in Europe, the EU has grown as a target of FN’s populism, and today constitutes a clear enemy of the French nation (Rydgren 2008, 170). This consistent opposition to various foreign influences warrants a 3 on the OTH_FOREIGN scale. We’ve seen no evidence for anything on the OTH_MILITARY variable (= 1).\nThe FN has always been strongly identified with the Le Pens (Balent 2013, 170; Stockemer 2019, 342), and although it has included anti-Le Pen factions over the years it has been highly centralised in its structure (Shields 1995, 23). Under Jean-Marie Le Pen it has been routinely called a “charismatic” party (Ivaldi and Lanzone 2016, 132), and despite Marine Le Pen’s less performative leadership style (Balent 2013, 162), it has maintained a similar “personality cult” around her (Stockemer 2019). We’ve therefore coded it 3 n CHARISMA.\nThis difference in leadership also relates to the party’s LIBDEMNORMS classification. We don’t see evidence that the party has ever been a 3 on this scale, and it appears to have stressed its support for democracy at various points in its life (Rydgren 2008, 176) in order to rebuff the accusation that it is a neo-fascist party, even while flirting with some authoritarian anti-system rhetoric. According to Balent (Balent 2013, 186), Marine has decisively sought to change course on this and develop an image for the Front that, while anti-establishment in the populist sense, is a part of the democratic political system. For this reason we have labelled the party 2 under Jean-Marie and 1 under Marine. Neither leader has ever been a member of a government (INSIDER = 1)."

    "text": "France Unbowed\nLa France Insoumise (LFI), which is variously translated as “France Unbowed”, “Rebellious France”, and “Unsubmissive France”, is the leftist party founded by Jean-Luc Mélenchon. Mélenchon, a former Socialist Party Minister between 2000 and 2002, left the party in 2008 over policy direction, initially founding The Left Party (Parti de gauch, PDG) and heading The Left Front (Front de gauche) coalition for the 2012 elections where we tallied a surprising 11%. While the PDG faded after that vote, Mélenchon’s profile received a major boost by the 2016 protests against labour reforms by the Socialist government (Damiani 2017, 2), after which he founded LFI to face the 2017 presidential and parliamentary elections on an anti-austerity and anti-neoliberalism agenda.\nMélenchon campaigned on a clearly anti-establishment discourse, vowing a programme of “degagisme” (clearing out) of the political “caste” (Ivaldi 2019, 4; Behrent 2017, 76) and a “citizen insurrection” via the ballot (Marlière 2019, 97). According to Ducange (Ducange 2015, 65) the “people” vs “elite” discourse was more important to Mélenchon than “left” vs “right”. He therefore avoided identifying as a leftist on the campaign trail (Marlière 2019, 96). This included parties on the left and right of the established party system (Clift and McDaniel 2017). The other (linked) enemy to Mélenchon’s idea of the ordinary people was the “oligarchy”, which he pledged to “sweep away” (Ivaldi 2019, 4) (OTH_FINANCIAL = 3). According to several scholars (Damiani 2017, 2; Marlière 2019, 100; Hamburger 2018, 103) Mélenchon and LFI are inspired directly by the Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe theory that broad and heterogenous opposition to neoliberalism should create new groups of citizens that transcend traditional categories like “workers” or organisations like unions – hence the party’s embrace of more populist social categories than the traditional left.\nThere is some debate about whether Mélenchon should be considered a populist in both the 2012 and 2017 elections. According to a number of sources, while he campaigned as a conventional left wing candidate in 2012, his second campaign shed many symbols and language of the left (class and social divisions, red flags and socialist anthems) and replaced them with patriotic symbols of a more general “people” (the national flag and anthem) which had traditionally been associated with the right (Marliére 2017; Hamburger 2018, 106–7). However some who document this very shift still identify classically people/elite discourse in his earlier run (Marlière 2019), and most voices in the literature categorise FDG as populist in 2012 (Ivaldi 2019; Ducange 2015, 65). We’ve therefore included the 2012 election and classified Melenchon as 2 on OTH_POLCLASS in 2012 (and 3 in 2017).\nLFI is hostile to the European Union on economic grounds. It has accused the EU of imposing a “tyranny” on France via liberal economic orthodoxy and free trade (Ivaldi 2019, 6), and called the Eurozone pressure for austerity “German Poison” (Ducange 2015, 70). Mélenchon has in fact routinely linked problems in Europe to the “German Imperium”, or Germany’s plan to reinstate its dominance over the continent (Bonansinga 2022, 518). While Mélenchon claimed in 2017 that his “plan A” was to radically reform the EU’s treaties, his “plan B” in the event of a failure was to leave the EU (Drake 2018, 98), and the Insoumise title of the party could be considered to refer (at least in part) to a reclaiming of sovereignty in the face of foreign pressure (OTH_FOREIGN = 3).\nAs opposed to the nativist FN, LFI is considered “socially inclusive” and did not campaign against immigration (Ivaldi 2019) (OTH_ETHNIC = 1, OTH_IMMIGRANTS = 1) It is universally considered a party of the “radical left” French tradition (despite Mélenchon’s eschewing of the term), and we have coded it FL on LRPOSITION. Its campaigns have been based around Mélenchon’s personal charisma (Lorimer 2017, 2; Ivaldi 2019, 10; Marlière 2019, 95), and he is usually considered a “strong personality” (Ducange 2015, 65) or even the leader of a “cult of personality” (Clift and McDaniel 2017, 411) that anchors the party’s image (CHARISMA = 3). As a “seasoned career politician” (Marlière 2019, 96) and a former cabinet minister, we’ve coded LFI 2 on INSIDER. The party is somewhat difficult to code on LIBDEMNORMS, but due to its general hostility to both media scrutiny and representative democratic institutions we’ve coded it 2 for now (Hamburger 2018, 100).\nNot included\nThere is a case that Emmanuel Macron’s movement (En Marche) is populist, given his opposition to the political party status-quo, appeals to common sense, presentation as a change agent, etc. - but populism itself is his “other”. He has therefore been called the “anti-populist populist” (Bordignon 2017). For these reasons he doesn't merit inclusion in the dataset\nReferences\nBalent, Magali. 2013. ‘The French National Front from Jean-Marie to Marine Le Pen: Between Change and Continuity’.

    "text": "Prosperous Justice Party\nThe Prosperous Justice Party (Partai Kaedilan Sejahtera, PKS) formed out of the Justice Party (PK) which contested the 1999 election without much success. Both emerged from networks of students without links to the major paties, linked to the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt emerging from the powerful tarbiyah movement of Islamist education. The PKS was an ostensibly Islamist party, and has been situated among the ‘modernist’ family of Muslim parties in Indonesia, but one that initially echewed calls for sharia and an Islamic state in favour of universalist policies focusing on clean government (Eliraz 2004, 124). The party had a breakout performance in the 2004 election, tallying 7.3%, doing particularly well in Jakarta (25%). It has since matched and exceeded that performance in subsequent elections.\nThere is frustratingly little written about the PKS’ precise rhetoric regarding the political class. In broad terms, however, there is wide consensus in the literature that the party accused the political system writ large of corruption and self-interest at the expense of ordinary people (Hasan 2009, 3; Smith 2004, 2; Liddle and Mujani 2005, 121; Aspinall 2005, 154; Nakamura 2005, 29). While all parties in the reformasi period (immediately post-Suharto) used the language of opposing ‘Korupsi, Kolusi, Nepotisme’ or KKN, the PKS was notably more extreme in calling for a more holistic “change of regime” (Aspinall 2005, 134). In Buchori’s words (cited in Collins 2003, 15): “[t]he party reiterates time and again that the present chaos in Indonesia is caused primarily by a lack of morality among the nation’s leaders”. In the 2004 election it released material citing the “24 reasons PKS is the enemy of slippery characters”, listing the multiple times that its leaders in provincial assemblies had refused to partake in corruption along with the major parties (Collins and Fauzi 2007). It built this image in part on the fact that it was both relatively young in in its leadership and cadres, and unconnected to the personalities or parties of the Suharto era – something unique among the major parties in 2004 and a major distinction between it and other Islamist parties like the PPP (Machmudi 2008, 11; Collins 2003). In contrast to the established political parties, PKS presented itself as “clean” (Shihab and Nugroho 2008, 253; Smith 2004, 3) and “caring” (Qodari 2005, 80; Liddle and Mujani 2005, 121), and emphasised its commitment to help “little people” who had been neglected (Machmudi 2008, 15; see also Siregar et al. 2020, 9; Slater 2004, 62–63). In Slater’s words: “PKS represents a challenge to this system insofar as it insists that politics should be about representing the rakyat (the people) rather than carving up the perquisites of state.” (Slater 2004, 62–63). According to Tanuwidjaja (2012, 535), the party’s rhetoric had not changed by 2012, even as it began to be mired in corruption scandals of its own. Under the leadership of Anis Matta from 2013, the party started to take on a more aggressive posture against the “enemies of PKS”, particularly the anti-corruption bodies that had pursued PKS leaders (Machmudi 2020, 174). Owing to the lack of direct examples of party rhetoric, and the fact that it adopted an increasingly accommodating strategy regarding other parties and elites over the years, a case could be made that the party should either be consistently coded 2 on OTH_POLCLASS or start at 3 and come to 2 in later elections. Further research should clarify this – according to the available evidence we’ve coded it 3 for the duration.\nPKS is Islamist in the sense of advocating piety to the core values of Islam, and proposing that these values could be used to solve national problems. It has not used religious identity in an exclusionary or defensive way to assert the rights of Muslims over others or posit that Muslims were under any kind of threat by the party’s main rivals (Hasan 2009, 6). In a number of ways, the party emphasised that it was not intolerant or exclusive of non-modernist Muslims, event the point of choosing non-Muslim candidates in some local elections (Collins 2004, 119). The party’s Islamic credentials have become even more moderate over later election cycles (Tomsa 2012), and its 2008 agenda explicitly praised the “plurality in Indonesian society” as an “asset” for national progress (Shihab and Nugroho 2008, 242). For this reason we’ve coded the party 1 for OTH_ETHNIC. Likewise, we’ve seen no evidence that it should register above 1 on either OTH_IMIGRANT, OTH_FINANCIAL, or OTH_MILITARY. The party’s consistent opposition to the United States and Israel – albeit on more of a pan-Islamic sense than a domestic grievances one – has been a consistent element of its rhetoric and appeal (Hasan 2009, 17; Machmudi 2008, 14). Given that this has not risen to the point of accusing domestic rivals of being controlled by these foreign states, we’ve coded the party 2 on OTH_FOREIGN.\nBeyond its general espousal of “clean” political values and practices, PKS did not, in Hasan’s words, have a “political blueprint for social transformation”, and lacked clear policy stances on many of the salient issues of the day, save several things clearly in its wheelhouse such as opposition to pornography and support for Palestine (Hasan 2009, 11). It has been consistently pro-welfare and anti-poverty (but not in a class politics sense) yet culturally conservative. Party Chairman Hidayat Nur Wahid called the PKS a “centrist Islamic party” (Collins 2003), and though there may be a case for coding it C on LIBDEMNORMS, the salience of cultural conservatism in its policy leads us to code it CR.\nThe party has neither opposed democracy nor supported violence (Nakamura 2005, 29; Kershaw 2004, 363). Though they are classified as an Islamist party, they have consistently eschewed calls to implement an Islamic state governed by Shariya, and maintain that participating in the democratic system is compatible with pursuing Islamic values in government (Collins 2004, 119; see also Hasan 2009, 4) (LIBDEMNORMS = 1) The PKS is generally considered to be genuine vehicle of mass participation and internal rules based democracy (Kershaw 2004, 362), without a reliance on leadership or an elite network. Numerous scholars have emphasised that the party did not revolve around its leader in the same way that other parties did at the time (Hasan 2009, 10; Baswedan 2004, 18) “PKS is the best organized of all Indonesian parties, with 400,000 carefully selected and well-trained cadres, and has cultivated an image of collective decision making in which no individual leader stands out.” (Liddle and Mujani 2005, 121). At no election has the PKS’s current leader served in a government (INSIDER = 1).\nGerindra, Prabowo Subianto\nPrabowo Subianto is a former military General and inner-circle member of the late Suharto regime (he was the Suharto’s son-in-law). After a period in exile after the collapse of the New Order regime, he returned and unsuccessfully sought the Golkar presidential nomination in 2004, losing out to Wiranto. In 2008, he created his own party, Gerakan Indonesia Raya (Greater Indonesia Party, or “Gerindra”) as a personal vehicle for his presidential aspirations. Gerindra underperformed in the 2009 elections (gaining 4,5%), but emerged in 2014 as a part of a coalition of parties big enough to support Prabowo’s presidential bid against Joko Widodo (Jokowi). Funded by his billionaire brother Hashim, Prabowo built alliances with conservative Islamist parties and movements, narrowly losing to Jokowi in both 2014 and 2019.\nDespite being a scion of the political establishment and oligarchy, Prabowo’s presidential campaigns have been based on a trenchant critique of the political class, whom he classifies as “corrupt” (Gammon 2020, 106; Rakhmani and Saraswati 2021; Warburton and Aspinall 2019, 266), and “traitors” (Aspinall 2015, 13; Kimura 2017, 1). While general accusation of corruption are commonplace among most Indonesian politicians, Prabowo elevated this rhetoric to a more precise and invective allegation that the nation was run by a “mafia” (Aspinall 2015, 18) that was “stealing the Indonesian people’s money” (Gammon, cited in Hadiz and Robison 2017, 493), in contrast to which he styled himself as the avatar of the “Indonesian people” (Aspinall 2015, 18; Hellmann 2017, 170). He applied this critique not to specific politicians or parties, but in blanket terms to the entire political elite (Aspinall 2015, 18; Hellmann 2017, 170) (OTH_POLCLASS = 3. Several scholars have pointed out that Prabowo mimicked the oratory style of Soekarno, even to the point of wearing similar safari suits and using replica microphones similar to those used by the former president (Aspinall 2015, 13).\nPrabowo’s critic of the political elite was bound together with a general accusation that the nation was being plundered by foreign forces (Hellmann 2017, 169; Mietzner 2014, 120; Rukmana and Sugito 2020; Rakhmani and Saraswati 2021, 453; Lane 2017, 3; Warburton 2020, 31). He used the term kebocoran, (‘leaks’) to suggest that the nation was bleeding its natural wealth to these foreigners, and used this narrative to explain most of the nation’s problems (Hatherell and Welsh 2020, 58; see also Warburton 2018, 140). His 2004 book claimed that “the domination of foreign powers” amounted to a “surrender” of national independence, and the enslavement of the people of Indonesia (Aspinall 2015, 14): “Our Indonesia” he said during the 2014 campaign, “is nurtured by foreign forces like a cow” (Robison and Hadiz 2017, 901). Domestic elites, he claimed, were either too “weak” to prevent this (Hatherell and Welsh 2020, 59), or complicit cronies to these foreign agents (Widian, Satya, and Yazid 2022, 11; Satrio 2019, 176; Mietzner 2015, 36; Hara 2017, 108). He extended this to Jokowi, whom he called antek asing (a “stooge of foreigners”) (Mietzner 2015, 36) who was actively “selling Indonesia off” to Chinese investors and labourers through his infrastructure programs (Warburton 2018, 139). He was vague in identifying exactly which foreign powers were involved in this, although he did single out the IMF for waging an “economic war” against Indonesia in the wake of the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis that hit the nation hard and triggered the downfall of Suharto (Aspinall 2015, 14) (OTH_FOREIGN = 3).\nThis rhetoric against “foreigners” is in many ways aimed at targeting domestic enemies, specifically Chinese and Christians (Widian, Satya, and Yazid 2022, 2). Even though neither Neither Prabowo nor Gerindra are hard line Islamists, their alliances with numerous Islamist factions has led many scholars to consider them “sectarian” (Warburton 2020, 31), “nativist” (Murphy 2019, 80) and “hostile to ethnic minorities” (Gueorguiev, Ostwald, and Schuler 2018, 242). While Jokowi is also a Muslim, the Prabowo campaign, in Warburton’s words, depicted Jokowi as an enemy of the ummah (the Muslim community) and as a threat to pious Muslims and Islamist organizations” (Warburton 2020, 28). This is built on a combination of Jokowi’s pluralist ideology, his association with various Chinese and Christian political figures (notably former Jakarta Governor Ahok), and a smear campaign that Jokowi was secretly a Christian. These were tactics of convenience for Prabowo, and ironically his shift to ally with Jokowi after the 2019 election saw him embrace the government’s harsh tactics against Islamist parties (Warburton 2020, 29–30). Nonetheless, given Prabowo’s consistent – albeit implicit – reliance on ethnocentric narratives, we’ve him and Gerindra as 2 for OTH_ETHNIC for the 2014 and 2019 elections.\nIn spite of his own enormous wealth and the family connections that helped to generate it, a significant pillar of Prabowo’s campaigns targeted the financial elite and wealth inequality itself (Warburton 2018, 135; Hara 2017, 108; Widian, Satya, and Yazid 2022, 11), and “drew heavily on narratives of economic injustice and exploitation” (Warburton and Aspinall 2019, 276). These are often bound up with the foreign exploitation narrative, as the domestic oligarchy is accused of profiting off the plunder of national wealth at the expense of the people (Widian, Satya, and Yazid 2022, 11; Satrio 2019, 176; Mietzner 2015, 36; Hara 2017, 108). Given that this anti-oligarchic element was a significant part of Prabowo’s discourse, but that it remained somewhat vague and secondary to other “other” narratives, we’ve coded OTH_FINANCIAL 2. We’ve seen no evidence for anything on the OTH_IMMIGRANTS (= 1), or OTH_MILITARY (= 1) variables.\nAs a party, Gerindra was totally controlled by Prabowo and his loyalists, and dedicated solely to the goal of making him president (Aspinall 2015, 9; see also Gammon 2020, 106). Numerous sources talk of Prabowo’s commanding, demagogic charisma as an element of both his and his party’s appeal (Widian, Satya, and Yazid 2022, 14; Kenny 2017, 33), and the fact that his rhetorical style was “self-referential to a degree that is unusual among Indonesian politicians” (Aspinall 2015, 13), something which contrasted with the political styles of other Indonesian politicians (CHARISMA = 3).\nPrabowo’s campaign constituted a direct threat to liberal democratic norms for several reasons. He has a well-known history as an “enforcer” against pro-democracy activists during the Suharto regime, and stood accused of several violations of human rights during that period (Aspinall and Mietzner 2019, 106; Mietzner 2015, 20). He also has what Warburton and Aspinall call a “well known history of personal brutality” (Warburton and Aspinall 2019, 258). He has consistently threatened democratic institutions since the collapse of the new order, including attempting to interfere with the vote count after the 2014 election (Mietzner 2014, 111). On a more ideological basis, during his campaigns he articulated an opposition to liberal democracy (Hadiz and Robison 2017, 494), despite assurances that he as in fact a democrat (Aspinall 2015, 20). This included support for returning to the 1945 constitution which included unchecked executive power (Aspinall and Mietzner 2019, 106; Satrio 2019, 176). and support for reforms aimed at “re-centralising... power and disassembling key democratic institutions” (Pardede 2020, 41), such as the abolition of direct presidential elections and returning to the system where a constituent assembly decides, this being more in line with “Indonesian traditions” (Lane 2017, 4). Prabowo has openly lamented that “Indonesia is not ready for democracy,” and considered a “benign authoritarian regime” more suitable (Mietzner 2015, 22). In a more general sense, many scholars have pointed out that Prabowo and Gerindra have become leading figureheads in an anti-democratic compact between nationalist oligarchs and hard-line Islamists. (Lane 2017). For these reasons they deserve a clear 3 on the OTH_LIBDEMNORMS variable.\nPrabowo and Gerindra have been called “nationalist” (Hellmann 2017, 162), “economically nationalist” (Aspinall 2015, 14) and “ultranationalist”(Arifianto et al. 2019, 44; Mietzner 2014, 112), “conservative nationalist” (Robison and Hadiz 2017, 901), and “right-wing”. While much of his economic rhetoric constituted a critique of liberalisation, “it would be a mistake”, in Aspinall’s words, “to exaggerate the policy cohesiveness or sophistication of his economic nationalism (Aspinall 2015, 15). Owing to this and the salience of Probowo’s cultural nationalism, we’ve placed him and Genindra as R on LRPOSITION. Given that Prabowo was a political/military insider in the Suharto regime (Aspinall 2015, 6), we’ve coded him 2 on INSIDER.\nNot Included\nThe Democratic Party of Struggle (Partai Demockrasi Indonesia Perjuangan, PDI-P) is the successor to the lineage of Indonesia’s first president, Sukarno, who was ousted by Suharto in 1967. It was formed in 1999 by Sukarno’s daughter, Megawati Sukarnoputri, who served as president from 2001-2004 and has remained a powerbroker since. Sukarno had a notably populist style, and some have suggested that Megawati embodied this style by claiming his political legacy and mandate (Thompson 1999, 2). However the available evidence suggests that Megawati has maintained an aloof personal style, characterised by “self-restraint” rather than charisma (Ziv 2001, 85), and that the PDI-P under her leadership has been similar to Suharto’s Golkar party. Before the 2014 elections she handed the party’s presidential nomination to popular Jakarta governor Joko Widodo, commonly known as Jokowi. The literature frequently considered Jokowi populist (Pardede 2020, 41; Hara 2017; Mietzner 2014; Hadiz and Robison 2017; Kenny 2022, 88), but this is more in the sense of his perceived kinship with ordinary people and genuine non-elite origins than any anti-elite rhetoric or outright rejection of the political status quo (Warburton 2018, 137). Jokowi has campaigned as more of a technocrat than a demagogue (Hatherell and Welsh 2020), offering what Aspinal and Mietzner call a “mellow developmentalist vision” (Aspinall and Mietzner 2019, 104). While he did campaign against corruption, this was done no more than any other politician (Hatherell and Welsh 2020, 60). For this reason we don’t think that he has met the WPD’s minimum definition of populism, and he is not in the database.\nThe National Mandate Party (Partai Amanat Nasional, PAN) is the creation of Amien Rais, a student leader during the reformasi protests against the Suharto regime. The party is explicitly secular but has roots in the modernist Islamic political tradition. Rias ran for president in 2004. PAN and Rais are occasionally considered “populist” (Liddle 2000, 35; Carnegie 2008, 4), but there doesn’t appear to be much evidence of this in their rhetorical approach other than the fact that Rais is considered “outspoken” (Ziv 2001) and clearly more charismatic than other party leaders (for more on PAN see Zenzie 1999; Sherlock 2004).\nReferences\nArifianto, Alexander R., Thomas Pepinsky, Evan A.

    "text": "Swiss Auto Party\nThe Swiss Auto Party (Autopartei der Schweiz, APS), was founded in 1985 by economic consultant and lawyer Michael Dreher to oppose environmentally conscious state interventions in the ives of citizens and the elite “do-gooders” who push them (Church 1989, 118). It soon expanded beyond its narrow focus on the interests of motorists to espouse a broad neo-liberalism and harsh opposition to immigration (Skenderovic 2007, 165). It achieved its best result in in the 1991 national elections with 5.1% of the vote. Soon after this it changed its name to the Freedom Party of Switzerland (Freiheits-Partei der Schweiz), but most of its supporters migrated to the SVP after that party’s move to the right in the late 1990s. It did not pass 5% after 1991.\nFurther to opposing state intervention in the ideological sense, the APS campaigned with “vehement and vocal hostility” towards established parties (Betz 1994, 21), accusing the entire “political class” of being “degenerate” and “wrecked” (cited in Skenderovic 2009, 110) (OTH_POLCLASS = 3). In Skenderovic’s words:\n\nThe populist nature of the APS/FPS was clear to see in the party’s consistent strategy of evoking resentment and mistrust towards government, state administration and the party system. It was clear that the party perceived an antagonistic relationship between the political establishment and ‘the people’, whom they saw as being betrayed by government, politicians and other political parties (Skenderovic 2009, 109).\n\nBeyond its neo-liberal resistance to state intervention, the APS’s policy platform was its opposition to immigration (Kobach 1993, 356). The party alleged that a “flood” of refugees were seeking asylum in Switzerland for economic reasons rather than persecution, and that they constituted a drain on state resources (Betz 1994, 121) (OTH_IMMIGRANTS = 3). The nature of these attacks have been considered xenophobic by many (Husbands 2000, 507; Skenderovic 2007, 170), as they particularly targeted non-European migrants (Betz 1994, 121), who allegedly threatened to “makes us Swiss strangers in our own country” (Skenderovic 2009, 111). We’ve coded APS 3 on OTH_ETHNIC, although there may be a case to leave it at 2. We’ve seen no evidence for OTH_FINACIAL or OTH_MILITARY (both = 1), and although the party opposed European integration, the literature does not emphasise that any OTH_FOREIGN rhetoric was a significant part of its discourse (= 1).\nAlthough the party was programmatically thin (Betz 1994, 108), its neo-liberalism and strong nativism make it clearly a part of the far right (LRPOSITION = FR). Skenderovic claims that “The APS/FPS was not characterised by strong leadership, nor was the party led by an uncontested, charismatic leader” (Skenderovic 2009, 108) (CHARISMA = 1), and we’ve seen no evidence that it was a fundamental threat to liberal democratic norms in Switzerland (LIBDEMNORMS = 1). Neither Dreher nor the party had served in government before the 1991 election (INSIDER = 1)."

    "section": "Swiss People’s Party",
    "text": "Swiss People’s Party\nThe Swiss People’s Party (Schweizerische Volkspartei, SVP) traces its roots to various agrarian and conservative movements in the twentieth century. From the 1950s it and its predecessor have been one of the parties included in the “magic formula” of power sharing on the Swiss federal council (McGann and Kitschelt 2005, 153). Most scholarship considers the party to be mainstream conservative and non-populist for most of this time (Mazzoleni 2013, 237; Bernhard 2017, 514). The rise of Christoph Blocher and his Zurich-based wing of the party changed this (Marcus 2000, 36). Given the traditionally decentralised nature of Swiss parties it is difficult to pinpoint the exact moment that the party should be collectively characterised by Blocher’s distinct populist rhetoric, but the best option seems to be the 1999 federal election (Rose 2000, 36), when Blocher’s emergence as its undisputed figurehead saw it’s vote increase dramatically to 22.5% from 14.9% in the previous election. The SVP has received approximately 25-30% in each subsequent election. We’ve therefore included he SVP from 1999 – 2019.\nUnder Blicher’s leadership, the SVP adopted “virulent” rhetoric against its rivals which converted it into a party of protest against the broader political establishment (Church 1996b, 642; 2000, 224). Further to it being incompetent, the political class was described by Blocher to be untrustworthy (Church 2000, 217–18), and to have betrayed ordinary Swiss voters (Bernhard, Kriesi, and Weber 2015, 131). This political class was therefore portrayed as being fundamentally antagonistic to the interests of the ordinary people (Mazzoleni and Skenderovic 2007, 93; Skenderovic 2009, 160). In Favero’s interpretation:\n\nIn a true populist manner, he repeatedly criticised the political elites in Bern who allegedly cared more for their own benefits than for Swiss citizens. To convey these messages to his followers, Blocher regularly uses the Albisgüetli Convention to explain “what is going on behind the scenes in Bern to abolish Switzerland.” The populist juxtaposition of ‘us’ (the good citizens) versus ‘them’ (the classe politique, the EU) clearly increased his charismatic appeal and the persuasiveness of his message. (Favero 2022, 489)\n\nIn contrast to these “power-loving system parties” (cited in Bernhard, Kriesi, and Weber 2015, 133), Blocher claimed that it was the true and sole representative of ordinary people’s interests (Mazzoleni and Skenderovic 2007, 93; Favero 2021, 254). As he put it: “We shall give this people a voice, while others increasingly crowd out this voice! Wherever a gap opens up between the interests of the citizens and the ‘political class’, we shall be the party of the citizen” (cited in Bernhard, Kriesi, and Weber 2015, 134) (OTH_POLCLASS = 3). Notably, Blocher managed to maintain this anti-establishment protest stance even while the SVP was a member of the governing coalition (Mazzoleni 2013, 243).\nThe SVP’s anti-immigration attitude has been one of the main programmatic element of its success under Blocher (Antonuk 2000, 23). It accused asylum seekers of abusing the system and threating the security of citizens (Church 2000, 218; Mazzoleni 2013, 246) (OTH_IMMIGRANTS = 3). In a number of ways this opposition to immigration has included xenophobic and racist components, as the party predominantly opposed non-European immigrants (Mazzoleni and Skenderovic 2007, 94). In the most notorious instance, the SVP’s 2007 election campaign included posters of white sheep kicking black sheep out of the country under the slogan “For More Security” (Michel 2015, 410). The party has also launched a popular initiative against the construction of Islamic minarets in 2009, and included in its platform its stance against “growing Islamisation” in 2011 (Mazzoleni 2013, 249). Blocher has also been accused of trying to “harness Swiss resentment at Jewish organizations” attempting to seek reparations for Swiss Banks’ activities during the Holocaust (Marcus 2000, 36). We’ve coded the party 3 on OTH_ETHNIC.\nOpposition to European integration was the issue that initially brought Blocher to prominence in the early 1990s (Church 1996a, 13; McGann and Kitschelt 2005, 154), and under his leadership the SVP became strongly anti-EU (Caramani 1996, 135). He presented the Swiss nation and its sovereignty as being threated from abroad, against which the SVP was the last line of defence (Mazzoleni and Skenderovic 2007, 93; Bernhard, Kriesi, and Weber 2015, 125). This included an attack against domestic heimatmiide Parteien (parties tired of their home country) (Caramani 1996, 132) (OTH_FOREIGN = 3). The party included no major economic component in its anti-elitism (Bernhard 2017, 514) (OTH_FINANCIAL = 1), nor any opposition to the military (OTH_MILITARY = 1).\nOwing to its strong economic neo-liberalism (Afonso and Papadopoulos 2015, see; Church 2000, 218) and the salience of its cultural nativism the party is generally considered far-right (Antonuk 2000, 24) (LRPOSITION = FR). Blocher’s charisma is routinely cited in the literature as a critical part of the party’s image and success under his leadership (Church 1996b, 641; Popper 1999, 12; Favero 2022), and coupled with the significant personal financial resources that he brought to the party (Church 2000, 217), the SVP “was built in a decisive way around its leader” (Mazzoleni 2013, 240). However, the party has always had a strong base and numerous factions opposed to Blocher (Favero 2021), meaning it doesn’t’ quite qualify for a 3 on OTH_CHARISMA (= 2). Several scholars have emphasised that the party was not a threat to liberal democratic norms – and on the contrary that it was extremely defensive of the Swiss political system and the constitution (Church 2000, 227; McGann and Kitschelt 2005, 154). We have coded the party 2 on INSIDER for its duration in the dataset given that it had been in coalition governments since the 1950s.\nReferences\nAfonso, Alexandre, and Yannis Papadopoulos. 2015. ‘How the Populist Radical Right Transformed Swiss Welfare Politics: From Compromises to Polarization’.

    "text": "Álvaro Uribe\nColombia has traditionally been conceived as an unfertile country for the emergence of populist forces (Dugas, 2003; Giraldo, 2018). Although Jorge Eliécer Gaitán and Gustavo Rojas Pinilla are considered examples of populism there is much debate on whether Álvaro Uribe Vélez, the most influential politician of the XXI Century in Colombia, can be classified as a populist or not. Uribe did not emphasize the opposition with the financial elites, was not particularly charismatic and rejected explicitly populism (Dugas, 2002: 1126). Uribe also defended orthodox and neoliberal policies because one of his main “three pillars”, “investment trust” was to make Colombia a secure and attractive place for foreign investment (Uribe, 2002). Moreover, Uribe was particularly known for his hard stance on security issues. The first of his three pillars was the “democratic security” which involved hardline policies regarding left-wing guerrillas such as the FARC.\nHowever, none of these are sufficient reasons not to classify Uribe as a populist. Uribe had been a member of the Liberal Party but ran as an independent in the 2002 election under a platform called “Colombia First”. He strongly criticized the political system at the time, saying in his 100 points manifesto (2002: point 4) that “I dream with a state that serves the people and not corruption and politicking” (“politiquería”). This last term is a derogatory way to refer to politics and it is very present in Uribe’s campaign, so much that one of his promises was to announce a “Referendum against Corruption and Politicking” as his very first action in government (Uribe, 2002: point 9). In that same manifesto, he also criticized pluralism by stating that “pluralism had been transformed into dispersion and anarchy due to the salaries, the clientelism and the pension privileges” (Uribe, 2002: point 22). Furthermore, he made constant references to the fatherland and aimed to achieve national unity in the fight against the guerrillas. Uribe clearly delimitated an “us” vs “them” based on support to his security policies. He divided society between “the patriots that support the policy of Democratic Security and the Communists in disguise that wish to sell the fatherland to the FARC” (Fierro, 2012: 130). He conceded no legitimacy to the guerrillas and attacked those who did as traitors. The only legitimate policy was to defeat the armed groups in order to achieve a country “without guerrillas, without paramilitaries… without drugs” (Uribe 2002: points 26 and 31). Some of the policies involved “praising the profession of soldier and policemen” (Uribe 2002: point 28) as well as paying regular citizens that had undertaken anti-terrorist actions (Uribe 2002: point 39).\nHis manifesto clearly states the protection of minority rights and immigration is not a relevant element in his platform. As a former governor of one of Colombia’s regions and mayor to one of its most important cities, Uribe was included in previous political settlements but was a peripheral figure in them. Although he created the new party and undertook a very personalistic style, the decay of the previous political system was evident and anti-corruption was a common platform among several parties in the 2002 election (Duges, 2003: 1126). Uribe declared a state-of-siege shortly after becoming president which was condemned by human rights organizations (El País, 2002), has attacked the press (Fierro, 2014: 139) and has been repeatedly accused of collaboration with far-right paramilitary groups (El País, 2006).\nHowever, the state-of-siege measure is quite common in Colombian history and he accepted the Constitutional Court’s decisions when they did not rule in his favor (Dugas, 2003: 1133). Therefore, I have classified him as 1 in Immigration and Ethnic Others and as 2 in Personality Dependent, Insider Populism and Violation of LD norms.\nIt is certainly difficult to classify Uribe into one category but there are enough elements in a world comparison, to include him in the database at this stage of the project.\nÁlvaro Uribe ended his presidency with one of the highest approval rates in Colombian history and his personality has profoundly marked politics after him. When he failed to pass a law that could allow him to run for a third time, Juan Manuel Santos was regarded as his successor. Santos had been Uribe’s Defense Minister and, although he ran a campaign that was also tough on the FARC, his profile was that of a rich technocrat that ran on a platform of continuity with Uribe’s politics. He argued that he was the opposite to populism and shortly after his victory he changed his discourse regarding the guerrillas. He initiated the “peace dialogues” with the FARC and that made Uribe distance from him. The most important expression of this conflict was the 2016 referendum on the Peace Agreement.\nSantos’ main rival in 2014 and its successor in the presidency in 2018 have both been successors of Uribe under the umbrella of the Democratic Centre, the party that Uribe founded in 2013 to confront Santos. The CD is a party regarded my many as right-wing although they explicitly situate themselves in the center. Uribe’s ideas have remained fairly constant throughout the past 20 years and the CD shares his programmatic points view, merely adding two more to Uribe’s three pillars (CD website). I have coded this party in the same manner as the rest of Uribe’s government in all legislative elections.\nHowever, the inclusion of the two presidential candidates of the Uribismo as populist is less clear. They both owe their popularity to being related to Uribe, they did not try to distance themselves from him and their discourses are less anti-elitists, more plural and more moderate than that of the leader of the CD. These politicians agree with Uribe on the substantive elements of his discourse but employ to a much lesser degree his populist strategies. Francisco Panizza (in private conversation) argued against including them in any populism dataset and Jorge Giraldo uses the label populist just to refer to the figure of Álvaro Uribe (Giraldo, 2019). I, too, agree that neither Óscar Zuluaga nor Iván Duque should be included. However, in case the team decides to include them, I have tried to find similarities in their discourse that may justify their inclusion.\nIn the 2014 presidential election, Óscar Iván Zuluaga’s motto was “on the side of the Colombians”. In a TV ad, Uribe reads a text in which defends Zuluaga’s candidacy in order “to vote against the Castro-Chavismo that some wish to bring to Colombia and that the government allows” (Zuluaga, 2014a). The election was dominated by the topic of the “peace process” in which Zuluaga (2018b) claimed he would stop the dialogues if he were to become president of Colombia. Zuluaga had been Minister of Finance with Uribe and did not make any claim against immigrants or ethnic minorities.\nIván Duque is difficult to classify as well. Constant references to the fatherland and Colombia and a clear opposition to the peace agreements situate him as a follower of Uribe´s politics. In his inaugural address he stated clearly his vision of popular unity when stating: “Let’s not let anything distract us from the path of union. No more divisions of left and right: we are Colombia; no more false divisions between neoliberals and socialists: we are Colombia; no more divisions between tendencies: we are Colombia” (Duque, 2018). Moreover, Duque tried to establish a direct connection with the people by stating over and over in one of his political adds “I am like you, proud of my country and willing to do anything for it” (Duque, 2018b). Duque was an unknown politician in 2018 which only had 4 years of experience as a senator. Previous to that he worked at international organizations in technical positions. His success depends mainly from being Álvaro Uribe´s chosen candidate. On immigration, Duque proposed the creation of a “humanitarian fund” for migrants from Venezuela that have fled the country (Tomaselli, 2018). Although Duque is included in the database for its belonging to the CD, its ties with Uribe and some aspects of his discourse, it should be noted that he displays a more moderated and plural understanding of politics than other members of his party (Tomaselli, 2018)."

    "text": "M-19\nThe party “Alternative Democracy M-19”, came out of a peace process between the government of Colombia and several left-wing guerrillas such as M-19. As part of these peace accords, a new constitution was drafted in 1991 and the guerrillas were included in the political process. The main ideology of the party was Marxist (Boudon, 2001: 75) but the party aimed at reaching a larger section of the electorate by presenting themselves as “the new political alternative” and “more than a party” (Villamizar, 1995: 571). The central issue for the party, however, was not communism, but democracy (Boudon, 2001: 76). Carlos Pizarro, leader of the M-19 until his assassination, employed populist tropes when he argued that “what we need to do is create something that attracts the nonconformists within the traditional parties, the nonconformists within the private enterprise, the nonconformists within the guerrilla ranks, the nonconformists within society in general… and which it is capable of offering proposals to the nation” (quoted in Beccassino, 1989: 110). The M-19 also heavily criticized Liberal President Gaviria’s neoliberal reforms and the hardline it took with the existing active guerrilla groups (Boudon, 2001: 81).\nTheir platform was based on 8 points: “(1) peace and an end to violence, (2) rejection of corruption and clientelism, (3) constitutional development toward a”social state of law”, (4) an economic policy based on production and an expanding socioeconomic base, (5) a specific employment program, (6) a pact to protect the environment, (7) priority for social programs, and (8) Latin American regional integration” (El Nuevo Siglo, 1993). Moreover, the party emphasized the need to end military impunity (Boudon, 2001: 89). They do not mention immigration or ethnic others as threats and the party did not take any action against the prevailing LD norms. Navarro Wolf, the presidential candidate, did briefly participate in Pastrana’s government as Health Minister but this was seen more as a political concession in the context of the peace process. Navarro Wolf belonged to the inner circle of decision making. Therefore, I have coded FL for ideology, 3 for Political Class, Financial Elite, Military and Foreign Interests and 1 for every other category."

    "text": "Gustavo Petro\nThe 2018 elections saw the emergence of a left-wing populist candidate, Gustavo Petro. Petro was part of the M-19 guerrilla and later of the party of the same name. When the party disbanded, he became part of the left-wing party “Polo Democrático” achieving the ranks of MP, Senator and presidential candidate in 2010. Petro later founded his own party, “Movimiento Progesista” and became mayor of Bogotá. He then run for president of Colombia in 2018 under the platform “Humane Colombia” (“Colombia Humana”). Since he never took part in any national government or belonged to any of the most popular parties, I have labelled 1 for Insider Populism. Gustavo Petro created the new party and the presidential coalition and ran on a populist platform based on his personal figure. None of these may have existed without the candidate himself although probably a left-wing variety of populism would have emerged in its place. Therefore, I have coded 2 for Personality Dependent.\nIn a TV advertisement, Petro clearly outlined his populist discourse: “The first time that a presidential candidate that does not represent the”politiquería”, not the power of the elites, nor the corrupts who have sacked the country and are now surrounding Duque, may win the elections” and “it is the first time that a government may be formed that really works for the people” (Petro, 2018a).\nCorruption is the main topic of his discourse and he relates all of Colombia’s problems to it. For example, he states that “the problem with the healthcare system is not that we need more money, but corruption” (Petro, 2018b). He also dilutes its ideological position when he defends that “I was leftist and I do not regret it but my proposal is not socialist, that did not work, we propose the development of a democratic capitalism based on granting access to a rural middle class to productive lands” (Petro, 2018b). However, Petro is very critic with the huge inequalities of the country and aims to distribute wealth extensively. I believe the best way to code Petro is with Left for Ideology, 3 for Political Class and 2 for Financial Elite.\nPetro’s opinion on the army was dominated by a comment he made in the campaign in which he said that “those youngsters that cannot study in university may end … in the drug cartels or trying to find a job in the police or the army” (Petro, 2018c). Petro (2018d) rejected the notion that he hated the military and defended himself by saying that he gave shelter to the army while mayor of Bogotá. I have decided to follow Petro’s own self-description and label him as 1 in military.\nI have found no significant action in violation of LD norms. In the campaign, Petro criticized that the Colombian foreign policy was subordinated to that of the US due to the money this country provides to Colombia to fight drug cartels (Petro, 2018e). He also argued for Colombia to occupy a more prominent and less subordinate role in international politics. During the crisis in Venezuela, Petro called for rallies against any military intervention in Venezuela by the US (Petro, 2019). Although Petro is clearly critic of foreign power interests, these are not constructed as the main threat to the country. I have labelled 2 in Foreign Interests.\nReferences\nBeccassino, A.

    "text": "Fernando Collor de Mello\nCollor de Mello was a member of an important family in Brazil and had been elected as mayor of Maceió and governor of the province of Alagoas before running for president. He held no position of relevance in the previous regime and was little known to the public before 1989. Coming from a underdeveloped and impoverished region, Collor de Mello run a campaign as an outsider differentiating himself from traditional politicians (Panizza, 2000: 181). He engineered a modern communication’s campaign based entirely on his personal figure (he ran for a small and not well-known political party). His campaign surpassed the traditional right-wing candidate and then defeated Lula’s party in the second round. I have coded 1 for Insider Populism and 3 for Personality Dependent.\nCallor de Mello based his campaign in fighting against corruption, criticizing in particular the “marajás” (high ranked civil servants) (Noielli, 2008). As Panizza puts it, “he was uncompromising in his attacks against the state’s bureaucracy, the political establishment and, particularly, against President Sarney” (Panizza, 2000: 182). He viewed the restoration of social order as a moral crusade against the “privileged political and economic elite that had become rich at the expense of the poor” (Panizza, 2000: 182). Collor de Mello claimed that he aimed “to make the right indignant and leave the left perplexed” and he even rejected endorsement by business groups (Panizza, 2000: 182-183). He defended the need to implement neoliberal policies in order to reduce the hyperinflation that the country suffered at the moment (Noielli, 2008) and he liberalized and opened the economy by drastically lowering the import tariffs (Panizza, 2000: 185). Collor de Mello was supported by important TV companies and right-wing groups of Brazil which wished to stop the rise of Lula (Ortiz de Zárate, 2016). I labelled 3 for Political Class and Financial Elite, “Right” for ideology and, given his desire to liberalize and open the economy against the wishes of a fraction of Brazil’s industrial elite, 1 in Foreign Interests.\nCollor de Mello implemented a number of shock policies designed to liberalize the country, reduce hyperinflation and break with the previous statist model of economic development (Panizza, 2000: 185). In line with his populist and personalist style, he also attempted to run with the support of the public opinion but without the backing of a stable party alliance. Panizza describes it in the following way: “Once in office, Collor faced two options: he could either radicalize the ‘politics of anti-politics’ campaign and refuse to acknowledge the legitimacy of the existing political establishment or, alternatively, become immersed in the political game, thus losing his status as political outsider. Eventually, Collor fell between two stools” (Panizza, 2000: 187-188). When his economic policies failed and he was accused of corruption by his own brother, the congress decided to impeach him. He resigned just before the impeachment, but congress incapacitated him for office for 8 years. Therefore, although Collor de Mello did not take the authoritarian route of Fujimori in Peru, he engaged in extensive corruption and refused to collaborate with parties in the parliament. I believe this should deserve a 2 in Violation of LD norms. I have not been able to find any negative discourse of immigrants, the military or ethnic others."

    "section": "Workers’ Party",
    "text": "Workers’ Party\nThe Workers’ Party is the most important party in Brazilian politics of the last decades. It was founded by a group of academics, intellectuals and union leaders led by Luis Inácio Lula da Silva, a popular union leader with no formal educational background. The party had a strong support base among labor unions and its organizational structure was that of a mass bureaucratic party (Hunter, 2010: 22). The party fits better in the classification of a socialist party than in a populist one, particularly when compared to a clear left-wing populist party such as Brizola’s PDT. Conniff (1999: 59) stated that Lula “could not even remotely be called populist” but Zedillo (2002: 55) argued that Lula ran on a populist platform. Lula da Silva ran unsuccessfully as a presidential candidate in 1989, 1994, 1998 and finally won in 2002. During this time, the party went through an important transformation in its discourse moderating its radicalism with every electoral bid (Hunter, 2010: 60).\nThe party’s platform was rooted in achieving socialism and in an opposition to trade liberalization, labor ‘flexibilization’ and neoliberal reforms (Hunter, 2010: 26). Moreover, “the PT adopted a pro-labor and anti-foreign capital positions in its Constituent Assembly” (Hunter, 2010: 26). It even proposed the nationalization of the financial sector in 1989. The 1989 campaign was very much based on populist rhetoric. It was depicted as a struggle between “rich versus poor, exploiters versus exploited” and the solution was a radical rupture with the previous system (Hunter, 2010: 110). The PT fiercely criticized the status quo and rejected privatizations because they were seen as “delivering the national patrimony over to greedy domestic and foreign interests” (Hunter, 2010: 111). Additionally, Lula da Silva’s image, as an uncompromising “bearded labor leader in rolled-up sleeves” (Hunter, 2010: 111) signaled his opposition to traditional politicians.\nCollor de Mello’s corruption and the economic hardship of the time encouraged the PT to continue with its oppositional politics and to present itself as proposing a radical departure from the existing order (Hunter, 2010: 117). Mentions to “transformation”, “revolution” and criticism of the “dominant classes” were common in the campaign and PT’s program concentrated on issues such as the external debt, land reform and privatizations (Hunter, 2010: 118). However, there was substantial moderation in the discourse, as Hunter (2010: 119) puts it “the zero-sum language of 1989 (e.g., the poor can only gain at the expense of the rich) gave way to the concept of ‘citizenship’” as a way of “guaranteeing basic rights to the population as a whole”. Although the possibility of a “third way” was rejected Lula, himself more moderate than the party, threatened to call off his candidacy if the radical trend the party was taken continued (Hunter, 2010: 121). In order to further his moderation, Lula chose Aloizio Mercandante as vice-president because of his links to the business world and to the military (Hunter, 2010: 121). I have coded 3 in Political Class, Financial Elite and Foreign Interest and Far Left in Ideology in 1994 and in all elections before.\nIn 1998, although Leonel Brizola ran with him as vice-president, Lula made an important change to the party’s rhetoric. The PT criticized Cardoso’s policies for exacerbating unemployment, but it did not propose any alternative model, nor did it question the need for privatizations beyond specific problems with the way they were being done (Hunter, 2010: 131). In addition, the PT abandoned the idea of the land reform and minimized the language around class struggle and dominant classes (Hunter, 2010: 132). Lula stressed its poor origins in order to connect with the people while downplaying his role as a labor leader (Hunter, 2010: 133). I have coded Left for Ideology in this election.\nThe biggest change, however, occurred with regards to the 2002 election. The words socialist or socialism did not appear in the 2002 manifesto and were replaced instead with the aim to “reform capitalism” and “democratize the market” (Hunter, 2010: 138). Lula wrote a “Letter to the Brazilian People” outside the margins of his party in which he pledged to maintain many of Cardoso’s policies, honor Brazil’s commitments with the IMF and keep a balanced budget (Hunter, 2010: 137). Furthermore, for the first time, the PT formed alliances with non-leftist parties. Jose Alencar, a businessman from the Liberal Party, was chosen to be Lula’s vice-president. Lastly, the change was not only one of moderation of policies, but of a different construction of the political leader. Confrontational politics were left aside to highlight Lula’s capacities as a competent, professional and experienced negotiator and politician (Hunter, 2010: 139). He was dressed in suits more often and one of the mottos of his campaign was “Lula, Peace and Love”. It is difficult to continue considering Lula as a populist in 2002. His campaign was ideological and rhetorically moderate and avoided the opposition between elites and the people that characterized his first campaigns. This does not mean that he was not committed to his leftist ideals, but that the discourse was not a populist one. I have decided, then, not to include the Workers Party in the database from 2002. From this election onwards, it is more analogous to a European socialist party than to a Latin American populist one. This applies as well to Dilma Rousseff’s time in government.\nLula’s popularity among the Brazilian electorate was PT’s biggest asset. He dominated all the presidential elections and was the undisputed leader of the party. In his path to moderation, moreover, he struggled to gain autonomy and independence from the party constrains. I have coded 3 in Personality Dependent. As an uneducated industrial worker and labor leader, Lula held no political power before the creation of the PT. I have thus, coded 1 for Insider Populism.\nLula strongly rejected the military dictatorship which made it very difficult for his party to be legally recognized in the 80s (Ortiz de Zarate, 2018). However, the military was not the main target of his discourse and he included the son of a military, Aloizio Mercandante, as his vice-president in 1994. Thus, I have coded 2 in all elections for Military.\nLula stressed the need to end corruption, rejected big business money and aimed at democratizing the market. Although his party become involved in several acts of corruption during his government which started in the 90s and he is now imprisoned for corruption as well, I have not found any explicit act aimed at violating LD norms throughout the 90s. I have labelled 1 for this category."

    "text": "Democratic Labor Party\nThe PDT was founded by Leonel Brizola and participated in elections even before the restoration of civilian rule. Brizola is widely considered as an example of left-wing populist (Conniff, 1999). He had gained a reputation for aggressive and confrontational politics in 1961, when he organized a revolt to support João Goulart’s, his brother-in-law, ascension to power (Conniff, 1999: 55). He was mayor of Porto Alegre and governor of Rio Grande do Sul, but he did not formally participate in the national government. Given his connections to the president of Brazil and his importance as a figure among the left-wing political elite, I have coded 2 in Insider Populism.\nHe was well known for promoting land reform (Stédile, 2005), rent control and nationalization of utilities (Conniff, 1999: 55) and he gained a reputation as an “anti-Americanist and an enemy of foreign capital” (New York Times, 1962). When the democratic government was overthrown by the military, he flew to Uruguay, from where he supported insurrectionist politics against the military dictatorship (Needler, 1987: 84). He moderated somewhat his discourse when he came back to Brazil in the 80s and embraced a left-wing position within the constitutional democratic context and the market economy (Needler, 1987: 85). Brizola later became governor of Rio and was notable for “founding integrated schools centers for children, curbing police abuses and pressuring congress to hold direct elections for president in 1984” (Conniff, 1999: 58).\nIn 1998, he ran a campaign based on popular mobilization, condemnation of corruption and inequality and criticism of the media (Brizola, 1992). Brizola did not change his discourse in later years: “His political views remained almost unchanged since the 1960's. Until his death, he advocated a militant form of economic nationalism, liberal benefits for government employees and a generous education policy.” (Benson, 2004). In 1995, for example, he criticized Henrique Cardoso´s policies by saying that “if there is no civil reaction to privatization, there will be a military one” (Diamond et al., 2010: 49). Brizola ran for Vice-president with Lula in the 1994 elections and lost and later censured him for betraying his leftist politics. I have coded 3 in Political Class, Financial Elite and Foreign Interest, as well as 3 in Military due to his opposition to the dictatorship. Brizola was the undisputed leader of the PDT and ran as its candidate throughout the 90s (3 in Personality Dependent). Lastly, due to his insurrectional politics and harsh criticism of the media I have coded 2 in Violation of LD norms.\nAfter Brizola’s death in 2004, the party held internal debated between those that defended continuity with Brizola’s politics and those wishing to adopt a more pragmatic and centrist stance and engage in collaboration with other parties (Ortiz de Zárate, 2018: 23). The party was slowly directed towards the second tendency. This is exemplified by the fact that they supported Dilma Rousseff for the 2010 and 2014 presidential elections. Moreover, in 2018, they chose Ciro Gomes, an experienced “center-left” politician (Sandy, 2018) that holds centrist macroeconomic policies (Schipani, 2018). I have not coded the party since the 2010 election because I do not believe it can still be considered populist."

    "text": "PRONA\nThe Party of the Reconstruction of the National Order was founded by Enéas Carneiro and defended a far-right populist ideology. Carneiro said that his electoral support indicated a “resounding and unmistakable repudiation of a political class that is rotten, dirty, repugnant and unpatriotic” (Rother, 2002). He ran for president unsuccessfully in 1989, 1994 and 1998. He argued for the development of an atomic bomb (The Boston Globe, 2007) in order to secure Brazil’s position in the world and “remind Great Powers that we are continental nation that needs to be respected” (Rother, 2002). He added that “the same is true of the Armed Forces, and if elected, I will triple its size, they are the armed wing of the people” (Revista Isto É, 1998).\nHis political platform was clearly based on economic nationalism. He defended the industry and private initiative but opposed at the same time the neoliberal speculative model. In his own words: “One word only: nationalist. We defend private initiative; we want to give a huge boost to the national industry. We need our industrialist to survive and not become, little by little, a reseller of foreign product. I want our farmer to produce, and not, as now, to have to import beans. The old concept of the left is finished. But also, what there is on the right, which today is assimilated to the speculative neoliberal model, which we do not really want. Therefore, there is no way to define this new model: we are nationalists, we defend private initiative, industrial, agriculture, everyone who wants to produce” (Gomes, 1998). I believe this opposition to one version of the economic elite at the same time as it praises another deserves a 2 in Financial Elite.\nAlthough immigration or ethnic others were not central topics in Carneiro’s discourse, his economic nationalist discourse linked the rejection of land gifts to indigenous communities with the rejection to foreign powers: “We condemn the intervention of one country in another, let each country solve its problems, I would say to the great powers: 'Leave us alone, leave our Amazon in peace.' Let's stop this story of giving a huge land, larger than Portugal, to half a dozen Indians. Let's end this internationalization story: the internationalized economy means, in other words: underdeveloped nations on their knees” (Carneiro, 1994). I have labelled 2 for immigrants and ethnic others and 3 for Foreign Interests.\nEnéas attacked the media harshly by saying that “The government, the media, and the research institutes lie, lie sordidly. This tripod forms a great power. Terrible power. Malignant. And it suffocates the population” (Carneiro, 1994). Furthermore, he was strongly opposed to LGBT rights (Roda Vida, 1994). I have coded Violation of LD norms as a 3.\nThe party relied heavily on his persona. Carneiro had a long and distinctive beard and was famous for energetically shouting “My name is Enéas” at the end of his political ads. It was all part of the construction of a political character easily recognizable as distinct from the political elites. The party did not fare well in legislative elections where Enéas was not the candidate (3 in Personality Dependent)."

    "text": "Jair Bolsonaro\nJair Bolsonaro won the 2018 presidential election on a right-wing populist platform. He has been called the “Trump of the Tropics” (Phillips, 2018) due to its nationalist, homophobic, pro-gun and far right discourse.\nBolsonaro was an army captain which later entered into the National Congress. He was a member of the congress for more than 25 years and belonged to seven different parties before running for president. Although he is an experienced parliamentarian, he never held any position in government (1 in Insider Populism). In 2018, he joined the Social Liberal Party and ran for president. Given this constant movement between parties, it is clear that it is Bolsonaro’s figure what attracted voters (3 in Personality Dependent).\nBolsonaro has criticized politicians such as Lula and Dilma for their corruption and defended the need to restore the country to its former glory. On economic issues, Bolsonaro has been a defender of free-market policies and open borders: “He set out a pro-market direction as he promised to lower the tax burden on business and make the country more open to foreign trade” (Financial Times, 2019). Additionally, he has pushed for a business-friendly agenda by putting in place well-known investors like Paulo Guedes and a former Treasury secretary and World Bank economist Joaquim Levy in key positions in his government (Rapoza, 2019). On foreign policy, Bolsonaro “has repeatedly said he wants to bring closer Brazil to the United States and Israel ‘The Americans played an extraordinary role in our history, preventing us from turning to Cuba in 1964’” (Manchikoni, 2018). However, he also bashed China, arguing that the Asian country did not just buy in Brazil but was, in fact, buying Brazil itself (Jingtao, 2019). Additionally, he has censored international NGO’s actions in his country: “This cowardly business of international NGOs like WWF and so many others from England sticking their noses into Brazil is going to end! This tomfoolery stops right here!” (Phillips, 2018a). I have coded 1 for Financial Elite and 2 for Foreign Interests.\nBolsonaro has repeatedly made comments against non-white ethnic communities. He claimed, for example, that “people living in reservations were ‘parasites’, that ‘quilombolas’ (black community members, descendants of runaway slaves) ‘weren't even fit for breeding’, that NGOs and social movements were stealing the country's resources, and that the only way to fight crime was handing out guns to the population” (Henrique Leal, 2017). Furthermore, he stated that the Funai (the National Indigenous Foundation) deliberately chose the “richest and most fertile” lands to “give away” to “Indians and blacks”, while stealing land from whites who had been “living there for centuries” (Henrique Leal, 2017). Bolsonaro is also famous for his religious nationalism. His campaign slogan was ““Brazil above everything, God above everyone” (The Economist, 2017). Previously, he had made remarks on the Christian identity of Brazil which Henrique Leal (2017) describes in the following way: “According to Bolsonaro, since Brazil is ‘a Christian country’, non-Christians should stay out of political life - as they are not ‘true citizens’. Islam and African religions should be banned, as they are antithetical to the ‘national faith’ and operate as an ‘open door to terrorists’”. I have labelled 3 for Immigrants and Ethnic Others.\nSexism is also one of Bolsonao’s trademarks. He famously said that “the only reason he didn’t rape” a congresswoman was “because she didn’t deserve it” because “she was too ugly” (Henrique Leal, 2017). Bolsonaro employs a similar marketing strategy to that of Donald Trump based on stating widely polemic comments to attract attention and an intensive use of social media to bypass traditional means of communication (considered by him as “fake news”).\nBolsonaro has a favorable stance towards Brazil’s former military dictatorship. In 1996, he explicitly said he was “in favor of a dictatorship” (Brooke, 1993) and in 2016, he dedicated his impeachment vote against Dilma Rousseff (who suffered torture during the military regime) to Carlos Alberto Brilhante Ustra, a famous torturer (The Economist, 2017). It is common to see him carrying guns and military symbolism is abundant in his rallies. In a rally shortly before the second round of the presidential election, he threatened to purge leftist outlaws and banish them from the country (Phillips, 2018b). Thus, I have coded 1 in Military and 3 in Violation of LD norms.\nReferences\nBenson, T.

    "text": "The case of India is difficult for several reasons. First, the sheer size of the country and its fragmented party system obscures some of the dynamics we’re searching for. The Indian National Congress (INC) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) are the only truly national parties in recent decades, but many state-based parties have mobilised on populist bases in individual areas which has shown up as only a fraction of the national electorate (Dravidian parties in Tamil Nadu and the Biju Janata Dal in Odisha are good examples of this). The fact that the major parties have formed alliances with these would suggest a case for coding the coalitions. But there is simply too much variation within these coalitions to justify this. The scale of national politics (and the diversity of issue-based mobilisation) also makes it difficult to say that any party relies on a single set of narratives and strategies, as these may vary from state to state. Second, the caste system and caste politics is a mixture of class, religion, and ethnicity, meaning that caste-based political mobilisation is difficult to categorise along out OTH_ variables. We have considered caste-based appeals to be ’ethnic' for the purposes for our study, noting that we should return to this characterisation.\nThe INC was the dominant party in India for several decades after independence, and was led by Nehru with a centre-left non-populist platform. When his daughter Indira Ghandi tool over the party in 1966 she took control from decentralised party bosses by building a more personalist leadership with direct communication to the masses and constructed a brand of left wing agrarian populism against local political elites (Kenny 2017). This was well established by the early 1970s, but according to most sources (Subramanian 2007) she toned this down in her second stint in power 1980-84 (only the 1980 election would fall within our time frame). That said, it may be the case that her 1980 election campaign should be considered in more detail."

    "text": "Bharatiya Janata Party\nThe Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is India’s largest right-wing party. As the successor to the Jana Sangh party, it has long been the national flagship party of “Hindutva” (Hindu nationalism) movement, and it is in many ways the political wing of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) volunteers movement (a Hindu nationalist paramilitary of sorts). However, the party leadership has oscillated between its more liberal and radical wings – initially led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Lal Krishna Advani respectively – each presenting somewhat different degrees of populism and ethnocentrism (Basu 2001; McGuire and Reeves 2003). The party’s first stint in government (1998-04, led by Vajpayee) is generally seen to have come duing one of its more moderate phases, and did not include radical policy changes on the key Hindutva issues such as the Ram temple dispute, Kashmir’s constitutional autonomy, or a uniform civil code. As with other major Indian parties, the party has rarely run true national campaigns, but rather tailored its message to individual states (Palshikar 2015, 725). Narendra Modi became the party’s candidate for Prime Minister for the 2014 election and led it to its most successful period to-date, capturing a majority in the Lok Saba and growing it in the subsequent 2019 election. The BJP has frequently been described as populist (see McDonnell and Cabrera 2019; Saleem 2021; McGuire and Reeves 2003), especially under Modi’s leadership.\nThe party has always attempted to cast the Congress-led political class as a corrupt ruling elite estranged form the people (Jaffrelot 1993:317). In its 1984 manifesto it claimed that “an unholy nexus has developed between the corrupt politicians, the corrupt bureaucrats and the corrupt businessmen” (cited in Malik and Singh 1994, 68). The BJP characterisations of the elite naturally focussed on the Congress Party, which it described as an irredeemably corrupt entity in service of the Gandhi family rather than the Indian people (McDonnell and Cabrera 2019, 489). Its conception of the “elite” also extended to Judges, NGO leaders and other established political parties who were accused of monopolising power and pandering to non-Hindu minorities (McDonnell and Cabrera 2019; Chacko 2018, 543; Sajjanhar 2021, 2). The damage done by this elite to ordinary Indian people was considered by the BJP as intentional and self serving. “[A]ll pervasive” corruption, according to the party, was not just the work of bad apples, but “reflect[ed] the bad intentions of those in power” (Chacko 2018, 554). In Modi’s own words (in 2014) “This country is not poor. The people of this rich country have been kept poor because of politics” (Jaffrelot 2015, 153). On multiple policy issues, Modi contrasted the will of the people with politicians. He declared that foreign policy, for example “should be decided by the people and not by some politicians sitting in Delhi” (Wojczewski 2020, 406). As with other variables, there is a case for OTH_POLCLASS to be coded 3 for at least parts of the BJP’s inclusion I the dataset. However as the scale and diversity for the party message is so significant, we’ve left this at 2 for now.\nThe party’s representation of Hindutva cultural majoritarianism has long associated it with political hostility to non-Hindu minorities, especially Muslims. While the party’s official rhetoric has often been careful to not declare an open hostility to Muslims in violation of the secular constitution (McDonnell and Cabrera 2019, 491), Muslims have always been accused by the BJP of receiving the favour of Congress for its own interests, and were generally constructed as a default “other” to the Hindu majority (Nielsen and Nilsen 2021, 92; McGuire and Reeves 2003, 97; Kaul 2017, 525). In the context of India’s geopolitical tensions with Pakistan, Muslims were often cast as a security threat. While the party has avoided the harshest anti-Muslim rhetoric from the top, various incidents by key leaders have indelibly linked its identity with anti-Muslim hostility. Advani’s made himself and the BJP the face of the Ayodhya dispute in the 1990s, which essentially drummed up an anti-Muslim pogrom in the name of rectifying the alleged destruction of the Ram Janmabhoomi Temple ccenturies earlier. There is an argument (Jaffrelot 2013) that the party radicalised in the 1989-1996 period under Advani’s leadership, during which it abandoned an attempt to woo coalition parties and mobilised heavily on the Ram Temple issue. However we don’t think this quite elevates the party to a 3 on OTH_ETHNIC. As leader, Modi talked almost exclusively about the economy in his first election and relied on others to make the Hindutva case (McDonnell and Cabrera 2019, 492). His image as a Hindutva hardliner was enabled more by his controversial handling of communal violence in the 2002 Gujarat riots as Chief Minister of that state. A number of the party’s actions in government bolstered its anti-Muslim image. For example it attempted to pass a controversial amendment to the Citizenship Act which would have granted citizenship to migrants as long as they were not Muslim (G. Singh 2019, 316). Given the varying strains of ethnocentric rhetoric across the enormous party, we have kept it at 2 on OTH_ETHNIC for the duration.\nThe BJP’s policies and rhetoric under Modi have been described as “business friendly” (Chacko 2018, 554; see also Kaul 2017), and apart from occasionally accusing the Congress party of being linked with corrupt businesses (see above), the party’s rhetoric could not be considered against financial elites in any significant way. This is in tune with Modi’s market based “Gujarat Model” of development and growth. Texts on the pre-Modi BJP don’t suggest that the party was fundamentally hostile to financial elites, the wealthy or big businesses then either. According to Kaul ( 2017, 525), the party was perceived in the early 1990s as a “party of middle-class commercial traders”. It is therefore coded OTH_FINANCIAL = 1 for the full period of its inclusion in the dataset. In the Modi era anti-Muslim rhetoric often overlapped with anti-immigrant rhetoric (McDonnell and Cabrera 2019, 491), particularly relating to Bangladeshi migrants who were considered the latest attempt by Congress to build a “vote bank” to keep them in power (Wojczewski 2020, 406). We’ve not found references to immigrants in the pre-Modi BJP, so OTH_IMMIGRANTS are coded 1 until 2014 and 2 after (this could be investigated further).\nIn conventional nationalist terms, Pakistan and China featured in BJP campaigns when portrayed as a beneficiary of Congress’s policies, and the party has generally benefited from military flare ups with Pakistan in Kashmir. This has often taken the form of collaborationist allegations against Congress: in one speech Modi asserted that if the government was “patriotic” they would put a stop to the violence on the disputed Chinese and Pakistani borders (Wojczewski 2020, 407). The BJP and its affiliates in the Modi era have also equated the Congress led elite of inheriting the British colonial mission to divide and weaken India, and continuing to do their work under the guise of secularism (Wojczewski 2020, 406). Enemies like NGOs and student activists were often portrayed as betraying India’s national sovereignty due to their foreign values and links (McDonnell and Cabrera 2019). None of this quite reaches the level of 3 on OTH_FOREIGN, so it has been coded 2. The BJP has always been a very pro-military party (OTH_MILITARY = 1).\nThe party’s consistent association with RSS and Ker Sevak militants and acts of communal violence against Muslims are the strongest evidence on the LIBDEMNORMS variable. Although the relationship between the Modi’s BJP and the RSS is arguably more distant than earlier (Palshikar 2015, 721), the attachment is still an important feature of the party. There have also been attacks on Dalit protesters under the BJP’s rule which the party has been silent on (McDonnell and Cabrera 2019, 494). Modi and his campaign have also demonised the mainstream (particularly English language) media, portraying him as a victim of their conspiracy, and in government Modi weakened the Supreme Court’s independence (Chakravartty and Roy 2015, 316; McDonnell and Cabrera 2019, 493). In Kaul’s words, Modi’s government delivered an “increase in political and economic violence and overt intimidation at all levels of society accompanied by plummeting levels of media freedom, a consolidation and centralization of power, and an openly hostile attitude to secularism and democratic principles” (Kaul 2017, 529). We have coded the party 2 on LIBDEMNORMS for the entire period, although this could be revisited.\nThe party has consistently been described as right-wing (Nielsen and Nilsen 2021, 92), and in the Modi era economically neo-liberal. R on LRPOSITION seems appropriate. Given the established institutions and identity of the BJP, it is not evident that the party has ever owed its existence to its serving leader. This is true even for the charismatic Modi – as McDonnel and Cabera (2019, 485) state, “[h]owever popular or powerful Modi is, the party will survive him.” Numerous accounts of Modi’s two elections, however, state that his persona was immensely important to the BJP’s collective meaning and performance to a degree unprecedented in recent Indian elections (Jaffrelot 2015; Wojczewski 2020, 405; Kaul 2017, 528). His personal image and strategy presented him with an “direct and institutionally unmediated relationship to his followers” (Subedi and Scott 2021, 497). For this reason we have coded 1 on CHARISMA until 2014 and 2 for Modi’s two elections."

    "text": "Bahujan Samaj Party\nThe Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) was founded in 1984 by Dalit activist Kanshi Ram, and led since 2003 by his appointed successor Mayawati. Both Ram and Mayawati are followers B.R. Ambedkar’s tradition of lower caste politics and critique of the Hindu system. The party has its roots in Uttar Pradesh (UP), but has also been present in other states in northern India. The BSP is dedicated to providing a political voice to those at the lower end of the caste system (The name Bahujan Samaj means “majority community”). It peaked in performance around the 1990s and 2000s, when Mayawati served as UPs Chief Minister four times for short stints. Due to its rhetoric against the upper castes the BSP has frequently been considered populist (Subramanian 2007; Lerche 1999). This is another party whose significance is understated by the scale of national politics, given its relatively small national footprint belies its success as a mass movement.\nThe party has attempted to win the support of lower caste (especially Dalit) constituencies who have hitherto traditionally supported the Congress Party. While this was initially limited to a few specific castes in the party’s early years, it grew to include a broader coalition of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (SC/STs), Other Backward Castes (OBCs), and religious minorities in the 1990s (Guha 2013, 6; Sarkar 2021, 73). The BSP accused Congress of treating lower castes as “vote banks”, providing token benefits to excluded groups but acting as vehicles for the upper caste elite that usually led the party (Guha 2011, 1–2; Pai 2009, 339; S. Kumar 2017). While Congress was the principle object of the BSPs critique, Kanshi Ram made it clear that their tactics were shared by the other major parties, such as the BJP and the communist parties, all of which “uphold consciously the degrading character of the social and political system” (Sarkar 2021, 67). In Guha’s words “The BSP’s depiction of the Bahujan Samaj (‘the community of the majority’) turned on a binary that pitted it against Hindu upper castes, who were portrayed as constituting both its political and ideological ‘other’ ” (Guha 2013, 1; see also Gundimeda 2014, 26).\nBoth Ram and Mayawati have relied on very provocative and exclusionary discourse against the upper castes to mobilise its base. For example Ram often began his speeches by inviting any upper caste attendees to leave the venue, and Mayawati has called Gandhi the ‘son of Satan’ (Jaffrelot 1998, 38, 46). According to Singh (2019, 48–49), one of the party’s “signature slogan[s]” was “we have the votes, you have the power, this will not last, this will not last”. In UP, other “deeply offensive” slogans were chanted in public BSP processions in public areas to antagonise upper castes (Duncan 1999, 45; see also Gundimeda 2014, 27–28). A study in Punjab noted that the party recruited voters by insisting that various material compensations by the Congress government do not compensate for the humiliation of the Hindu caste system, the elite of which still governs them in the political class (Chandra 2000). The BSP generally softened its rhetoric against the upper casts in the late 1990s and early 2000s, to the extant that Mayawati tried extensively to recruit upper caste members into the party (V. Kumar 2007; Pai 2009, 345; N. Singh 2019, 49; Gundimeda 2014, 28). However, it still emphasised that upper castes were generally untrustworthy and maintained its general posture of hostility towards them. Owing to this shift, we’ve coded BSP as 3 on OTH_ETHNIC in the elections up to 1999, and 2 from the 2004 general election on, though this could be revisited. Given that the BSP essentially linked upper caste ethnicity with political power, we’ve taken this as OTH_POLCLASS rhetoric as well. However given that the OTH_POLCLASS dimension of this did not soften as the party tried to bring in upper caste members (on the contrary, it alleged that upper castes too had been abandoned by the elites), we have kept OTH_POLCLASS at 3 for the duration of BSP’s inclusion in the dataset.\nGiven the overlap between political and economic dimensions of the castes system, one might expect there to be a degree of hostility towards economic “others” like businesses and the wealthy. However this appears not to be the case, as several scholars have noted that the party does not actually campaign on economic issues relating to classed-based material redistribution, but rather caste exclusion in strictly social, cultural, and political contexts (Duncan 1999, 36; Chandra 2000). According to Singh (writing on Punjab), the BSP had no social or political programme, relying instead on identity (N. Singh 2019, 51). In Duncan’s words “it’s appeal and campaigning appear to be far more caste based than class oriented and it has been primarily concerned with issues of social oppression and exclusion than with those relating to economic exploitation” (Duncan 1999, 36). For this reason, we’ve coded it 1 on OTH_FINANCIAL. The literature similarly presents no evidence of a significant hostility to the military, immigrants, or foreign powers in the BSP’s discourse (OTH_MILITARY = 1, OTH+FOERIGN = 1, OTH_IMMIGRANTS = 1).\nDespite being an “ethnic party”, the BSP in government or opposition has not been affiliated with communal violence in the same way as the BJP has (N.

    "text": "Austrian Freedom Party\nThe Austrian Freedom Party (Freiheitliche Partei Österreichs, FPÖ) traces its roots back to organisations representing former Nazis disenfranchised in Austria’s initial post-war elections. After founding as a party in 1956 its first two leaders were former Nazis and the party carried an illiberal taboo in the party system (Fallend 2012, 116–17). With an ideologically ambiguous character, it participated in several minority governments before 1980, and strived to moderate its controversial image. We see no evidence that it was populist by our definition in the 1983 election, so we’ve included it in the dataset only from 1986, when Jörg Haider took it over and moved the party to the hard right in policy and rhetoric (most authors agree that this is when it should be classified as populist, see: Van Kessel 2015, 35; Heinrisch, 2013, 47; Fallend 2012, 117; McGann and Kitschelt 2005, 151). After improving its electoral performance through the 1990s the FPÖ joined a coalition government with the centre right ÖVP between 2000 and 2005, following which Haider split off to form his own party (BZÖ) that took the FPÖ’s spot in the coalition. The FPÖ then became a new opposition party under the leadership of one of Haider’s former mentees Heinze-Christian Strache, who gradually rebuilt its following to peak at 26% in the 2017 election, after which it again formed coalition government with the ÖVP. After Strache was caught on tape dealing corruptly with an undercover journalist (the “Ibiza Affair”) he was forced to leave politics, and the party’s vote dropped to 16% in the 2019 elections.\nHaider converted the FPÖ into a protest vehicle that tapped into the dissatisfaction with the political system. A cornerstone of this was his opposition to “partitocracy” of the dominant national parties, the SPÖ and ÖVP (McGann and Kitschelt 2005, 151). Haider’s rhetoric projected a system in which a “ruling class” (cited in Wodak 2013, 23) was both homogenous and fundamentally separate from the ordinary people (Bauböck 2009, 243). He accused this political elite of enjoying embedded privileges that allowed them to line their own pockets at the expense of ordinary people (Höbelt 2003, 56). In Betz’s words, the FPÖ:\n\npursued ‘a strategy of system change’ intended to liberate the ordinary citizen from the political parties… Its self-proclaimed goal was to solve what it saw as one of Austria's most urgent political problems, namely citizens’ growing alienation from the state, by engineering Austria's transition from a ‘party state’ to a ‘citizens’ democracy. (Betz 2001, 401)\n\nEven when the party was in government, Haider continued this stance by fashioning himself into a kind of internal “opposition” within the coalition (Heinrisch, 2013, 51). After Haider stepped down from the leadership the party appears to have maintained this stance (see Heinisch, Werner, and Habersack 2020; Wodak and Forchtner 2014). Stache, for example, has alleged that the government deliberately allowed for the asylum system to be abused in order to tend to the interests of the “asylum industry” at the expense of the people (Ajanovic, Mayer, and Sauer 2018, 13). For this we have coded the party 3 on OTH_POLCLASS for the duration of its time in the dataset.\nSoon after taking control of the party Haider made antipathy to immigrants and ethnic others a core component of its discourse and agenda under an “Austria first” platform. Initially his ethnocentric rhetoric was largely based in antisemitic comments and symbolism (at one point he alleged that he was a victim of a “Jewish” smear campaign, see: Heinrisch, 2013, 63), and included other forms of xenophobia (McGann and Kitschelt 2005, 151–63). The party succeeded in mobilising against immigration and asylum seekers in the context of the crisis in the Bulkans in the early Haider days, but from the 1990s dramatically turned its attention to Muslim migrants (Fallend 2012, 118), whom it considered as a cultural threat to the nation, a drain on the welfare system, and a source of crime and radicalism (Heinrisch, 2013, 62–63). Strache has maintained this “virulently anti-Muslim” posture (Turner-Graham 2008, 181), with the party campaigning against “invading Muslim hordes” (Wodak and Forchtner 2014, 239) and conflating immigration with crime under his leadership. We’ve therefore coded the FPÖ 3 on both OTH_ETHNIC and OTH_IMMIGRANT.\nThere was a clear anti-foreign element to Haider’s Austria First rhetoric, and at one point he targeted the “Brussels mafia” during debates about European integration in the 1990 (though he ended up supporting membership) (Hockenos 1995, 76). The party then took an anti-EU line in the 2000s on the slogan “People’s Representatives instead of EU-Traitors” (Turner-Graham 2008, 197). By the late 2010s (or possibly earlier), Strache and other party leaders claimed that the government was a “stooge” of European Commission, “agents” of the EU, and “the parrot of Merkel” (Heinisch, Werner, and Habersack 2020, 171). This appears to be an elevation of OTH_FOREIGN rhetoric, and hence we’ve coded the party 3 on this variable from 2016 and 2 before then, although the timing of this shift could be investigated further. We’ve seen nothing that indicates any hostility to the military (OTH_MLITARY = 1).\nHaider was clearly a very effective and charismatic leader (Hockenos 1995, 76) (Murphy 2004, 306), known for performatively braking taboos surrounding political correctness (Betz 2001, 407). Strache appears to have modelled his own image on Haider (Heinrisch, 2013, 52), and has been just as important to the FPÖ’s image as Haider was (Heinrisch, 2013, 57). Due to the strong influence of its leaders the FPÖ has been called a “leader cult” (Bailer 2018). However the party clearly has an institutional history that goes beyond its leaders (Heinrisch, 2013, 65), and has withstood multiple leadership transitions. We have therefore coded it as 2 on CHARISMA.\nThe party's economic agenda is complicated (see Heinrisch, 2013, 64), but it has generally remained liberal and deregulatory, despite the occasional comment against international capitalism. There are also elements of liberal or libertarian ideas in its policies (McGann and Kitschelt 2005, 152; Rathgeb 2021, 646). We've kept the OTH_ECONOMIC variable at 1 and coded it FR in LRPOSITION due to the salience of its cultural majoritarianism.\nThe FPÖ (even well before Haider’s arrival) had a clearly illiberal image within Austria due to their linkage to former Nazis (Fallend 2012, 115). Haider’s right wing majoritarian and ethnocentric rhetoric clearly re-established this image, as has his (and Strache’s) various associations with far-right groups in their youth. The party’s calls for a more direct and republican democratic model have also been viewed as illiberal in this context (see Adamson 2010, 156). However we’ve not found any evidence that party has linked the party’s actions or policies to violations of liberal democratic norms in the institutional sense. We’ve coded it 2 for LIBDEMNORMS due to its Nazi lineage, but this could be investigated more. We’ve coded the party 2 on INSIDER in each election since 2000, after which it formed a coalition government with the ÖVP."

He served as leader of the new party, and sought a relatively more moderate orientation that was more open to forming government (Heinrisch, 2013, 48). Although most of the far right policies are similar to the FPÖ, it is difficult to decide whether these differences would manifest on a 1-3 scale. Given that the party was led by Haider, we’ve coded it the same as FPÖ in the one election in which it scored above 5% (2008). The exception to this is the CHARISMA variable, given that the new party was formed around Haider."

    "section": "Team Stronach",
    "text": "Team Stronach\nFounded in 2012, Team Stronach (TS) was a vehicle for Canadian-Austrian billionaire Frank Stronach. An “entrepreneurial party” backed financially by Stronach and linked to his business (Heinisch and Saxonberg 2017, 210), TS spent heavily in the election and recruited several BZÖ MPs to form a parliamentary caucus before the election. It won 5.7 % in the election, narrowly making it past the 4% threshold to enter parliament, but dissolved into infighting soon afterward and did not participate in the 2017 election.\nStronach’s central campaign theme was his “radical anti-establishment” hostility towards the political class (Hloušek, Kopeček, and Vodová 2020, 96), whom he considered fundamentally corrupt (Dolezal and Zeglovits 2014, 646; Schmuck, Matthes, and Boomgaarden 2016, 88; Van Kessel 2015, 35; Brett 2013, 411). Stronach’s rhetoric crafted politicians as self-serving and categorically estranged from the interests and experiences of citizens (Hloušek, Kopeček, and Vodová 2020, 98). This is well-captured by one of his catch phrases: “the politicians want to serve themselves. I want to serve Austria” (Luther 2014, 24) (OTH_POLCLASS = 3). According to several sources, Stronach also targeted business elites and banks (especially in the context of the Euro debt crisis) (Hloušek, Kopeček, and Vodová 2020, 98), considering them an element of the corrupt “system” alongside politicians (Luther 2014, 25). As this appears somewhat narrow we’ve coded him 2 on OTH_ECONOMIC = 2. Euroscepticism was also a key part of his narrative (Hloušek, Kopeček, and Vodová 2020, 98; Dolezal and Zeglovits 2014, 645), albeit not quite to the level that would warrant a 3 on OTH_FOREIGN (= 2). We’ve seen nothing that indicates any hostility to the military (OTH_MILITARY = 1).\nStronach’s central policy platform was economic neoliberalism, stressing his business credentials and a managerial approach to governance (Hloušek, Kopeček, and Vodová 2020, 95). He did not target immigrants (Heinrisch, 2013, 49; Dolezal and Zeglovits 2014, 645), or make xenophobic statements (Brett 2013, 411) (OTH_ETHNIC = 1, OTH_IMMIGRANTS = 1). Given the salience of his economic liberalism he has been generally positioned on the ideological right (Schmuck, Matthes, and Boomgaarden 2016, 86) (LRPOSITION = R). Although Stronach had a number of somewhat authoritarian law and order positions (including advocating the return of the death penalty), we’ve not seen enough evidence to consider his campaign a threat to liberal democratic norms (LIBDEMNORMS = 1). As its name suggests, the party was Stronach’s “personal project” (Hloušek, Kopeček, and Vodová 2020, 95) and relied on his charisma (Heinisch and Saxonberg 2017, 220). Media coverage also focused far more on Frank Stronach than on his party (Hloušek, Kopeček, and Vodová 2020, 97), and there appeared to be no organisational coherence other that his leadership (CHARISMA = 3). Stronach did not serve in any government before the campaign (INSIDER = 1).\nReferences\nAdamson, Goran. 2010. The Spectre of Austria—Reappraising the Rise of the Freedom Party from 1986 to 2000.

    "text": "After German unification in 1990, the former ruling communist party of the eastern German Democratic Republic became the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS). While maintaining a presence in the Bundestaag in the 1990s, the PDS party was generally seen as an eastern regionalist party without national appeal. This changed somewhat when it merged with the renegade left faction of the Social Democratic Party opposed to Chancellor Gerhard Schröder in 2005, the Electoral Alternative for Labour and Social Justice (WASG), to form Die Linke (“The Left”). This was technically an electoral alliance in 2005 but was formalised as a unified political party in 2007. According to several scholars, Die Linke was a fundamentally different party to the old PDS (Patton 2013, 220). The new party’s vote doubled in 2005 from the PDS’s previous performance, and peaked at 11.9% in the 2009 election. While there is an argument that the PDS itself should be included in the dataset, several scholars have argued that its political style and platform did not constitute populism as practiced by Die Linke (Decker and Hartleb 2007, 447).\nDie Linke advocated a clearly populist agenda and style under the leadership of former WASG member and federal Minister for Finance Oskar Lafontaine, who led the party until 2010. The party’s ideology, while generally far left, has always been somewhat undefined and simplistic (Hough and Koß 2009, 82). According to Hough and Koβ, its platform has been a combination of a broad opposition to neoliberalism, advocacy of pacifism in foreign policy, and a populist opposition to “bad guys” – especially financial elites and big business (Hough and Koß 2009, 82; Thomeczek 2023, 5) (OTH_FINANCIAL = 3). Aside from economic elites of various stripe, the party opposes the threat of foreign imperial forces (the US and NATO) (OTH_FOREIGN = 2), and the political class of elite politicians supposedly owned by capital (Hough and Koß 2009, 85; Hough and Keith 2019) (OTH_POLCLASS = 2). In both these registers however, the party does not quite reach a 3 by our definition. There is no evidence of any populist rhetoric regarding OTH_ETHNIC (although there is a case to be made that is regionalist in representing the interests of East Germans), OTH_IMMIGRANT, or OTH_MILITARY (all = 1).\nWhile Die Linke had organisational roots and factional divisions, Lafontaine’s leadership of the party does seem to have been substantially significant to its political meaning and appeal (Decker and Hartleb 2007, 449; Patton 2013, 222). This does not appear to have been replicated by any leader since his departure in 2010 (Patton 2013, 231) (CHARISMA = 2 2005-2009, 1 2009-2020). The party advocates a rethinking of German democracy, including more direct forms of participation and decision making (Hough and Koß 2009, 84; Olsen 2018, 77). As it stated in 2017, “elections become a farce if those elected allow their decisinos to be dictated by big corporations and the wealthy and thus evade democratic scrutiny” (Hough and Keith 2019, 137). While this reflects a general criticism of the status quo of German liberal democracy, it is not clear that this constitutes a threat to LIBDEMNORMS in any way that would register on our scale (= 1)."

    "text": "Alternative for Germany\nThe Alternative for Gernamy (AfD) was formed with several minor members of the centre-right CDU-CSU before the 2013 election, driven principally by opposition to German bailout of debtor nations in the Eurozone. The party narrowly missed the federal electoral threshold of 5%, but grew rapidly in its early months and started to articulate clearer policy stances on matters other than the Eurozone issue (Arzheimer 2015, 541), causing some conflict among the various factions that had flocked to it as a general protest party of the right in 2013. The party entered Parliament in the next election (2017) with 12.6% of the vote, by which time it had moved many of its policies closer to the conventional European far-right.\nAccording to many scholars (Arzheimer 2015; Arzheimer and Berning 2019, 1; Dilling 2018), at the time of the 2013 election the party was not particularly populist or radical, acting as a general protest party and avoiding German taboos about the radical right. In fact, Angela Merkel’s move of the CDU/CSU to the centre, coupled with the fact that most of the new AfD had ties to that party’s conservative wing, led some to consider the AfD a new centre right challenger to the CDU/CSU (Dilling 2018) (note that the party is not coded for this election as it was under the 5% threshold). In 2015, a power struggle saw the departure of moderate party leader Bernd Lucke and his faction, leaving those in favour of more nativist and populist rhetoric in charge. Months later, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s liberal response to the refugee crisis of 2015-16 saw an rise in support for the party based on the hardline anti-immigration and anti-Islam stances of its new leaders (Arzheimer and Berning 2019, 3).\nSince the fall of fascism, German politics is extremely hostile to radical nativism and abnormally pro-EU integration, making even small movements on these scales seem relatively significant even when they do not match regional or global standards. While awareness of this fact should temper allegations of any party’s radicalism, the AfD did employ populist and radical stances on several key variables in the 2017 election. New leader Frauke Petry made headlines by suggesting that refugees could be shot at the border, and built ties with the Austrian Freedom Party (FPÖ) and other far right parties (Arzheimer and Berning 2019, 3). The party also allied with the radical Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the Occident (PEGIDA) organisation (Dilling 2018, 88), started to advocate closing borders with European neighbour states in order to prevent the arrival of asylum seekers (Dilling 2018, 89), and claimed outright that “Islam does not belong in Germany” (Olsen 2018, 78). For these stances it is generally seen by the literature to feature the kind of anti-immigrant and ethnonationalist stances as other populist right wing parties in Europe (Hartmann, Kurz, and Lengfeld 2022, 139) (OTH_IMMIGRANT = 3, OTH_ETHNIC = 3).\nAfter 2015 the party also adopted a populist rhetoric against the “political class of career politicians”, a.k.a. the “political cartel” (Dilling 2018, 88), earning it a 3 on OTH_POLCLASS (see also Hansen and Olsen 2019, 3; Olsen 2018, 71; Goerres, Spies, and Kumlin 2018; Berbuir, Lewandowsky, and Siri 2015, 173). In one election program, the party spoke of a “political class whose overriding interest is only its own power, status, and material benefit” (Olsen 2018, 79). While attacking all established parties as enemies of the “volkisch” (a highly sensitive word in Germany given its association with Nazism), the party focused its rhetoric on Merkel in 2017, who is deemed to have betrayed “the people” by allowing refugees to enter (Nociar and Thomeczek 2018, 2). The party is Eurosceptic, but not exceeding a 2 on OTH_FOREIGN.\nWhile many have accused the AfD of being an authoritarian radical right party, it is not evident that it should register on the LIBDEMNORMS scale. While its original members were insiders in the CDU/CSU, these were not powerful enough to register on the INSIDER variable by 2017. It is also not evident that the CHARISMA of the party leaders is particularly important for its political meaning.\nReferences\nArzheimer, Kai. 2015. ‘The AfD: Finally a Successful Right-Wing Populist Eurosceptic Party for Germany?’ West European Politics 38 (3): 535–56. https://doi.org/10.1080/01402382.2015.1004230.\nArzheimer, Kai, and Carl C.

Despite possessing the biggest party organisation at the time, it polled a disappointing 8.7% and disappeared soon after as the independence question receded (Arter 1995, 253, 261). It acted as a coalition partner to the conservative Pro Patria party in government, where it was seen to moderate much of its rhetoric and policy (Auers and Kasekamp 2015, 144). By 2015 it merged formally with Pro Patria to create the Pro Patria Union, which does not appear to be populist or radically nationalist.\nThe party’s nationalism in 1992 is generally considered “radical” (Kivirahk 1993, 157; Auers and Kasekamp 2015, 144) (LR_POSITION = FR), and takes shape particularly against Russian interference (OTH_FOREIGN = 3), and the Russian ethnic minority in Estonia (OTH_ETHNIC = 3). According to Mäe (Mäe 1995, 211), the party saw Estonian statehood as the only mechanism by which the Estonian people can survive the geopolitical threat of their neighbours.\nWe have not seen evidence that it campaigned against the domestic (OTH_POLCLASS = 1). Available evidence suggests that it was generally free-market (Mäe 1995, 212), despite being, in Fitzmaurice’s words, “less interested in economic issues” than nationalist ones (Fitzmaurice 1993, 173)(OTH_FINANCIAL = 1). Despite being a well-organised party it had not participated in government by the time of the 1992 elections (INSIDER = 1), and its leadership is not often considered significant to its identity (CHARISMA = 1). Further research should probe whether the party violated LIBDEMNORMS – for now we have seen no clear evidence that it did so (= 1)."

EK polled a surprising 6.9% in 1992 but drifted into obscurity by the time of the 1995 poll, after which it disbanded.\nEK was built around the personality of Toomepuu (Kasekamp 2003, 405) (CHARISMA = 3). It has been considered an “anti-party” party (Millard 2004, 70) due to Toomepuu’s “aggressive, American style populism” (Kasekamp 2003, 405; Kivirahk 1993, 158; Auers and Kasekamp 2015, 144; Arter 1995, 257; Rosimannus 1995, 33). He was particularly convinced that the former communist elite was still running the country via the post-transition parties (OTH_POLCLASS = 3).\nIdeologically, EK is considered to have a lot in common with the ERSP (Kasekamp 2003, 404; Auers and Kasekamp 2013, 237), specifically in its advocacy of forced repatriation of ethnic Russians (Kasekamp 2003, 405; Arter 1995, 266), and for this reason we’ve coded it 3 on OTH_ETHNIC and OTH_FOREIGN, and FR on LRPOSITION. We have not seen much evidence for the LIBDEMNORMS variable, but given that Mikkel claims that the party “never questioned the legitimacy of the political system as such and never used illegal methods in the political process” (Mikkel 2006, 28), we’ve kept this variable at 1."

In a similar vein to Sweden’s New Democracy, the party and its “Territorial Marshal” Kalle Kulbok campaigned in costumes (Arter 1995, 266).\nThe party did not have many serious policies (Arter 1995, 266; V. A. Pettai 1993, 119) (Estonia has never actually had a monarchy of its own), and the party even decided some votes in parliament by coin toss (Clemens 1994, 399). we’ve therefore labelled them N/A on LRPOSITION. There is no evidence that the party was a threat to democracy (LIBDEMNORMS = 1), nor any hostility to OTH_ETHNIC, OTH_FOREIGN or OTH_FINANCIAL. However the Royalists are universally considered to be an “anti-party protest” party (Kivirahk 1993, 157; see also Wilder 1993, 76; Arter 1995, 266; Rosimannus 1995, 33) (OTH_POLCLASS = 3).

The party is a personality vehicle for Savisaar, a charismatic figure almost universally considered “controversial” for his sharp rhetoric and corruption allegations. Savisaar’s domineering personality, according to many observers, defined the party until he was replaced in November 2016 (Saarts 2015, 220) (CHARISMA = 3). After this, we have not included the party as populist, given that this designation in the literature seems to rely on Savisaar’s personal stylings, without which it is a mainstream party (although this could be confirmed by further research).\nNumerous texts consider the party populist (Millard 2004, 112; Saarts 2015, 214; Sikk 2004, 9; Jakobson et al. 2012, 59; Ehin 2002, 99), with reference to Savisaar’s hostility to other parties.

    "text": "Res Publica\nRes Publica (RP) was founded in 2001 as a youthful party that attacked the petty squabbling and corruption of the dominant parties. The party had extraordinary success in in its first election in 2003, benefiting from popular discontent with the likely coalition government between the two major parties. Upon joining government it lost most of its popularity and then joined in a union with Pro Patria for the 2006 elections onwards, where it seemingly became non-populist (Učeň 2007, 59). The party had much in common with New Era in neighbouring Latvia.\nRP campaigned on a generally populist “new politics” appeal (Sikk 2009, 7; Saarts 2015, 214). The party made corruption its central issue, and campaigned in a generally protest narrative against the entrenched parties (Saarts 2015, 214, 223). However, it seems that its anti-politics “purifying” image was not as explicitly hostile against the political class as other populists, making it similar to populists like Simeon II in Bulgaria (Taagepera 2006, 84–85). For this reason, we’ve left it as 2 on OTH_POLCLASS. It did not take a stance on Estonia’s ethnic political issues (Saarts 2015, 217) (OTH_ETHNIC = 1), or, to our knowledge, anything that would register on the OTH_FOREIGN, OTH_IMMIGRANT, or OTH_FINANCIAL variables.\nThe party had a vague and ambiguous ideological standing (Sikk 2004, 10; Saarts 2015, 217), but is usually considered centre-right (Učeň 2007, 56; Saarts 2015, 215; Taagepera 2006) (LRPOSITION = CR). There is a case that it should actually be classified as centrist based on the non-ideological way that it campaigned in 2003, which should be explored further. The party did not rely on its leader (Saarts 2015, 221; Taagepera 2006, 84) (CHARISMA = 1), did not violate any LIBDEMNORMS (= 1), and could not be considered INSIDER prior to its initial victory in 2003 (Taagepera 2006)."

Pettai and Toomla 2003, 6). It did very well in the 2003 elections (13%), forming coalition government with the Centre Party, but faded after political scandals (Saarts 2015, 214). From obscurity, some members of its base merged with the Estonian Patriotic Movement to for the Estonian Conservative People’s Party (EKRE) (see below) in 2012.\nWhile not a great deal is written about the party, numerous texts mention in passing that it was populist (Taagepera 2006, 80; Jakobson et al. 2012, 59). Appealing almost exclusively to rural voters, ER featured “to some extent” (Jakobson et al. 2012, 73) a redemptive discourse in which it portrayed itself as the protector of the “people” (OTH_POLCLASS = 2). Jakobson et al claim that it engaged in some degree of ethnocentric rhetoric against non-white immigrants (Jakobson et al. 2012, 73). However, Saarts (Saarts 2015, FN 224) states explicitly that the party avoided a “far right” outlook in contrast with the EKRE, and we have coded these variables more moderately (OTH_IMMIGRANTS = 2, OTH_ETHNIC = 2, OTH_FOREIGN = 2).\nThe party is difficult to categorise on LRPOSITION, as it was socially conservative but economically left wing (V. Pettai and Toomla 2003, 27). Most commentators seem to consider it centre-right (CR) (Petsinis 2019, 217; Braghiroli and Petsinis 2019, 5) and we have coded it such. Saarts does not consider the party’s original leader Villu Reiljan to be particularly charismatic (Saarts 2015, 2020) (CHARISMA = 1), and there is no evidence that it departed from the norms of liberal democracy (Jakobson et al. 2012, 72) (LIBDEMNORMS = 1).

It achieved break-out success of 8.1% in the 2015 elections, performing far better than any far-right party in Estonia since the early 1990s. This surged to 17.8% in 2019, primarily on the back of the European migrant crisis. It has signed a declaration of support with the Latvian National Alliance (NA), with which it has a lot in common.\nThe party’s ideology is anti-globalist, ethno-centric and radically nationalist, making it an exemplar of the European far right (LRPOSITION = FR). Among numerous examples of this ideology and rhetoric, it has advanced an officially racist immigration policy, supported controversial monuments dedicated to Nazi collaborationist soldiers who fought against the Soviet Red Army (Auers and Kasekamp 2015, 145), and campaigned against the “Islamization of Europe” (Braghiroli and Petsinis 2019, 11). It considered the migration crisis the deliberate work of global elites done to undermine the mono-ethnic nation state (Kasekamp, Madisson, and Wierenga 2019, 9). While explicitly hostile to immigrants (Kasekamp, Madisson, and Wierenga 2019; Veebel 2015), Wierenga claims that its most important “other” is the domestic Russian-speaking population (Wierenga 2017, 3). For all these positions the party is coded 3 on both OTH_ETHNIC and OTH_IMMIGRANT.\nThe party espouses a distinctly anti-establishment rhetoric (Braghiroli and Petsinis 2019, 11; Makarychev and Sazonov 2021, 461), and presents itself as an alternative to the political class (Auers and Kasekamp 2015, 146). For example, at its inception in 2012 it claimed to “offer a viable alternative to the voters who are sick of the forced choice between [Reform Party and Centre Party] East and West, left and right” (cited in Braghiroli and Petsinis 2019, 5) (OTH_POLCLASS = 3). It is strongly opposed to Russian interference (Lanko 2015, 51), denouncing a 2014 border treaty as a “give away” (Auers and Kasekamp 2015, 146). It is also critical of the EU for taking away Estonia’s sovereignty (Wierenga 2017, 8), imposing its cultural liberalism and enforcing bailout packages for southern European states (Braghiroli and Petsinis 2019, 6; Braghiroli and Makarychev 2022, 132). In the words of its 2018 programme, ““the sovereign nation state has been transformed into a vassal state representing the interests of the European Union, of foreign capital and of parasitic elites” (Braghiroli and Makarychev 2022, 135). For both of these stances it is coded 3 on OTH_FOREIGN. The party does make some reference to taxing foreign capital (Braghiroli and Makarychev 2022, 135), but generally does not place the same significance on economic issues as other ones (Braghiroli and Petsinis 2019, 5). We have coded it 2 on OTH_FINANCIAL.\nThe party is very closely associated with its charismatic leader Mart Helme (Trumm 2018, 334), and his son Martin Helme, who, according to Auers and Kasekamp, have injected “dynamism and energy… into the moribund radical right” (Auers and Kasekamp 2015, 145) (CHARISMA = 3). EKRE has a very different membership, leadership and ideology to the People’s Union (Saarts 2015, 214), and thus should not register on INSIDER (= 1) even though the latter had been in power (Petsinis 2019, 215). Wierenga claims that the party “does not espouse anti-democratic rhetoric” (Wierenga 2017, 6), and that the party does not have a militant wing such as, for example, Jobbik in Hungary. The party possesses a lively youth wing (“Blue Awakening”) that organises militarised “patrols” and rallies (Kazharski and Makarychev 2020, 173). It has also floated plans to regulate the media, which it considered part of the “establishment” (Kasekamp, Madisson, and Wierenga 2019, 20). Given Wierenga’s analysis, we have left EKRE’s LIBDEMNORMS coding at 2."

    "text": "The APRA has been Peru’s main leftist part party for most of the 20th Century. It was founded and headed by Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre, who was considered as the prototype of populist leader in Perú (Stein, 1999: 101) and who presided the constitutional assembly of Perú after the military government of General Velasco Alvarado. The first democratic elections were held in 1980 and Armando Villanueva was the candidate for APRA. In his campaign spots there are references to the mobilization of the people such as “Armando will come, the people will triumph” (Villanueva, 1980a) or “we will take care of the poor people above all” (Villanueva, 1980b). Nevertheless, there is no explicit criticism of the elites and his campaign should be understood as aligned with that of a leftist ideology. I have not found any references in the literature that treat him a populist and in 1985, he supported Javier Valle in the primaries against Alan García when the former accused the later of risking the “leftist position” of the party with his “Caesarist style” (Ortiz de Zárate, 2016). This episode points to the fact that Villanueva was more a traditional left-wing politician than a populist and thus, I have not included him in the dataset."

    "text": "Alan García\nAlan García won the presidency in 1985 as the candidate of APRA. García had never held office positions before (1 in Insider Populism). He employed several populist methods such as the “balconazos” (spontaneous public appearances in the balcony government to make announcements and speak with the people (Stein, 1999: 111)). He also appeared unannounced at different places in the country to discuss and talk with the citizens. García defended his platform as nationalist and claimed that his aim was to “give the people back their government” (García, 1984) so that it would “not be the loot of a few who share the membership of the party of the government” (García, 1985). García based his campaign in criticizing the neoliberal economic model of President Belahúnde, on critiquing corruption in the public administration and in fighting the violence of the guerrilla group “Sendero Luminoso” (Ortiz de Zárate, 2016). Moreover, he aimed at creating a broad class interest, including the “business class” in the efforts to make the economy grow (Crabtree, 1996: 576; Ortiz de Zárate, 2016). I have coded 3 for Political Class but 2 for Financial Class.\nAlan García developed a “personality cult” (Crabtree, 1996: 576) around his figure. The APRA was established as a party long before García, but his personality greatly shaped it in 1985 (2 for Personality Dependent) and explains in part its success (El País, 1986).\nThe leader of APRA defended economic nationalism against international banking and the institutions directed by Washington (Crabtree, 1996: 575) and said that “IMF’s hateful and damaging mediation only benefits those who wish to see more inequality” (Ortiz de Zárate, 2016). In the presidency, he later declared a restructuring of the debt and nationalized several industries. Therefore, I have coded 3 for Foreign Interests.\nAlan García was investigated by corruption during his government as well as promoting, or at least, allowing for repressive counter-terrorist measures to take place by the paramilitary group “Comando Rodrigo Franco” (Ortiz de Zárate, 2016). I labelled 3 for Violation of LD norms.\nOn the relationship with the army, Alan García declared a state of emergency in several areas in order to fight “Sendero Luminoso”, which gave the army considerable power for long periods of time (El País, 1986). I found no reference in which he considers the military to be part of the elite.\nGarcía’s government ended in very poor economic conditions, with inflation reaching very high levels and the conflict with “Sendero Luminoso” raging. His popularity plummeted and Luis Alva Castro was chosen as the candidate to run in the 1990 election for APRA. After the 1990 election, Alan García was persecuted by Fujimori and had to flee the country. He later moderated his discourse and neither in the 2001 nor in 2006 (when he won for the second time) should he be considered a populist. Luis Alva Castro, the APRA’s candidate in 1990 did not had the populist discourse that Alan García had employed in his 1985 election (Crabtree, 1992: 164). As second Vice-president and Ministry of Economy, Alva Castro was seen as part of the establishment and could not shake-off the blame for the terrible economic situation of the country (Crabtree, 1992: 160). I have not included him in the dataset."

    "text": "Alberto Fujimori\nAlberto Fujimori was a mathematics professor and university rector from Japanese descent who had never held elected office or had been part of a political party before 1990 (Levitsky and Loxton, 2012: 164). He was completely unknown to the public and neither him nor his newly created party, “Cambio 90”, were polling strongly until shortly before the election (1 in Insider Populism). He was able to beat his opponent, the writer Mario Vargas Llosa, due to its condition as an outsider and anti-politician figure (Stein, 1999: 115). The country suffered at the time a very severe economic crisis for which traditional parties were blamed (Levitsky and Loxton, 2012: 165). Moreover, the conflict with “Sendero Luminoso” was also at its peak and confidence in politicians was extremely low (Levitsky and Loxton, 2012: 165). Although the party would have not existed without Fujimori, his success is explained more by the economic and social circumstances of the moment than by Fujimori’s popularity. I believe this deserves a 2 in Personality Dependent.\nFujimori ran a campaign based on the criticism of the establishment and looked for a direct connection with the people. He adopted the slogan “A President like you” (Levitsky and Loxton, 2012: 167) and defined the election as a “confrontation between the white elite … and the non-white common people” (de la Torre, 2000: 124). He mobilized sectors of the population that were at the margins of politics, particularly evangelicals and the informal sector (Levitsky and Loxton, 2012: 166). On economic issues, Fujimori vehemently opposed the neoliberal shock doctrines that he attributed to Vargas Llosa. In the presidential debate, Fujimori told Vargas Llosa that state’s intervention had created “a complex system of incentives which are not in favor of the poorest but that respond to the power groups that, unfortunately Dr Vargas, lie behind you” (Fujimori, 1990). Fujimori should be labelled 3 in Political Class and in Financial Elite.\nFujimori belongs to a small ethnic minority in Peru, a fact that he employed to depict himself as someone of the margins, someone who represented the Peru of the “the cholos”, that is, the darker-skinned poor majority that was looked down upon by the white elite (Panfichi, 1997). He actively embraced the nickname “el chino” and the C90 lists included several candidates that “spoke Quechua and worked in the informal economy” (Daeschner, 1993: 261). On Foreign Interests, Fujimori travelled to the US before his inauguration and struggled to maintain good relations with foreign powers during his presidency (McClintock, 2002).\nSimilar to the case of Menem in Argentina, shortly after winning, Fujimori took a turn to the right and embraced neoliberal reforms. Levitsky and Loxton (2012: 169) and Weyland (1999: 184) explain that he forged a tacit alliance with the power groups of Peruvian society, including the military, the internationally competitive industry and the financial sector. This, however, did not make him less populist. He simply “lost the class-based elements of his anti-elite discourse and stepped up his attacks on the political elite” (Levitsky and Loxton, 2012: 170). For the 1995 elections, I have changed from 3 to 1 the category of Financial elite and I have coded Ideology as “right-wing” instead of “left-wing”.\nSince he was still constrained by a legislative chamber dominated by traditional parties, he argued that Peru was not a real democracy. In 1992, backed by the military, he carried out the “autogolpe”, a presidential coup which allowed him to close the congress, dissolve the constitution and purge the judiciary (Levitsky and Loxton, 2012: 171). The “autogolpe” was widely supported by Peruvians and it was followed by elections for a constituent assembly, a referendum on the new constitution and again presidential elections in 1995, which Fujimori won by a landslide. Newspapers and television networks received large amounts of money by the government to assure their support (Levitsky and Loxton, 2012: 176) and he declared a law of amnesty for the military. Fujimori’s own constitution banned him from running for a third re-election, but he refused to obey the constitutional tribunal, made the congress impeach the judges and ran in 2000 under the platform “Perú 2000” (Conahgan, 2005: 126-300). His opponent, Álvaro Toledo, boycotted the election for considering it corrupt and Fujimori was elected again. Soon after, however, a video showing a close associate of Fujimori bribing politicians triggered the downfall of the regime. Fujimori flew the country and new elections were called in 2001. All the actions of Fujimori clearly deserve a 3 in violation of LD norms."

New Majority and C90 created a coalition named “Alliance for the Future” and tried to present Alberto Fujimori as their candidate for the 2006 presidential election. However, since Fujimori was disqualified by the congress to run for office, Martha Chávez, former President of the Congress in the 1990s, was elected as the running candidate (1 for Personality Dependent and 3 for Insider Populism). Her platform continued the politics of “Fujimorismo”.\nIn 2011, “Fujimorismo” presented Keiko Fujimori, Alberto’s daughter, as the presidential candidate of “Force 2011”. Keiko had become first lady of Peru after her parent’s got divorced in 1994 and belong to the inner circle of his father’s government. Keiko made it to the second round in both the 2011 and 2016 elections but lost both of them. Her right-wing populist campaign is based in means-targeted policies for the poor, a tough stance on crime and an opposition to LGBT rights (El Mundo, 2016). Keiko continues employing an anti-elitist discourse. After losing the 2016 election, for example, she said that “in the second round, our opposition included the political power of this outgoing government, the economic powers and the powers of the media,” (Dow Jones Institutional News, 2016). Moreover, she argued that her party would “defend the interest of the people against lobbies and the power of big business” (Dow Jones Institutional News, 2016). I have coded her in a similar fashion as Alberto Fujimori’s 1995 and 2000 campaigns."

Together with his brother, Ollanta carried out a failed coup d’état against the government of Fujimori in 2000 which made them win popularity. They were later pardoned by the Congress and Ollanta founded the Peruvian Nationalist Party in 2005. However, he did not register it on time for the elections and decided to run as the candidate of another party; Union for Peru. He had never held an governmental position or participated in party politics before (I for Insider Populism).\nFor the 2006 election, Humala moderated somewhat his discourse, he declared himself as nationalist but not “etnocacerista” and embraced democracy (Nesbet-Montecinos, 2011: 85). Ollanta’s campaign was considered to be “left nationalist”, was supported by Chávez and Evo Morales and strongly opposed neoliberalism (Nesbet-Montecinos, 2011: 86). Humala made extensive use of the colors of the Peruvian flag in his campaign and used as motto the phrase “love for Peru” (Cabanillas, 2016: 183). He blamed the “traditional politicians” for the misery of Peru (Revesz, 2006: 91) and in the presidential debate against Alan García, Humala (2006) tried to depict his opponent as corrupt and as representative of an outdated elite (3 for Political Class). Ollanta rejected the United States–Peru Trade Promotion Agreement and defended the nationalization of the energy industries (Nesbet-Montecinos, 2011: 86).\nOllanta moderated considerably his anti-capitalist stance in the 2011 election (Cabanillas, 2016: 183). He stilled enjoyed the support of Chávez and Morales and criticized harshly the corruption of the politicians before him. Thus, I have lowered from 3 to 2 Financial Elite and Foreign Interests in 2011.\nHumala was accused of violation of human rights in 1991 (Revesz, 2006: 91) and linked to the assault to a police station perpetrated by his brother in 2004. In 2011, he signed a “Declaration in favor of Democracy and Against the Dictatorship” in which he defended the independence of the judiciary, the respect for human rights and the rejection of corruption, which granted him the support of Vargas Llosa and other intellectuals that wished to prevent a victory of Keiki Fujimori. However, Humala is currently investigated for corruption during his time in office. I have labelled these mixed evidence as 2 in Violation of LD norms.\nOllanta’s platform emphasized the need to reinvigorate the countryside of Peru, particularly of its indigenous people (1 in Immigration and Ethnic Others). On the military, Humala criticized the use of the military under Fujimori’s regime but, being himself a commander, he supported greatly the army during his years as President by investing heavily in them (Humala, 2015).\nHumala’s campaign was based entirely on his figure; in 2006 he ran as a candidate of another party and managed to reach to the second round unexpectedly. The posters in the 2011 election emphasized the personal figure of Ollanta in a campaign in which he moderated somewhat his views. The movement would not have existed without him and that is why I have labelled 3 in Personality Dependent."

She had been an MP of the Peruvian Nationalist Party but left the party in 2012 and joined the Broad Front (“Frente Amplio”). In the Presidential debate she clearly employed a populist discourse when saying that “we face an election, or we continue to have governments that are at the service of the very few or we have a government that is at the service of the people” (Mendoza, 2016). She also stated that “we will be a government of the people” and that “in a government of the Broad Front, the priority will be you” (Mendoza, 2016). Mendoza received the support of Pablo Iglesias, leader of Spain’s “Podemos”, and has linked ecology with an anti-elitist message: “government after government have consumed our resources without thinking about the people” (Mendoza, 2015). The axes of her platform were “an economy that excludes nobody, a state without corruption, rights without discrimination and progress without contamination” (Mendoza, 2015).

SMP formed as a splinter faction of the Agrarian League in 1959.\nThe party espoused an anti-establishment populist line aimed at rallying “forgotten” rural voters, frustrated with the “urban elite” (Lahti and Palonen 2023, 130), and losing out in the rapid period of urbanisation and industrialisation (Norocel 2016, 43; Arter 2012, 813). In particular, the party took aim at the long serving government of President Urho Kekkonen, the ruling group of political parties, and Russian influence especially (Arter 2010, 486) (OTH_POLCLASS = 3, OTH_FOREIGN = 2). As Ylä-Anttila put it: “The enemy was the political and economic elite in the cities, ‘the money power’, which Vennamo famously referred to as ‘crime lords’” (Ylä-Anttila 2017, 25). This opposition to corrupt business interests – particularly its opposition to “monopoly capitalism” (Sänkiaho 1971, 40) – seems strong enough to warrant 2 on OTH_FINANCIAL. We cannot see any evidence that the party was nativist in the sense of OTH_ETHNIC or OTH_IMMIGRANT (1).\nIt was reliant on the leadership of Vennamo (Ylä-Anttila 2017, 25) even after his son formally took over in (it was a “family business” in this sense, (Arter 2012, 813)) (CHARISMA = 3).

Its breakout election came in 2011, when it was the only anti-EU party in parliament and therefore positioned to capitalise on the widespread anger at Finland’s participation in the bailout of southern European countries. After Jussi Halla-aho took the leadership in a “hardliner coup” in 2017, the party’s more moderate wing split off to form the Blue Reform group in th e2019 election. The Halla-aho led Finns however maintained their vote share, receiving 17.5%.\nPS self identifies as “populist” and criticises the “old parties”/“cartel parties” in its championing of “forgotten” (a term popularised by the SMP) ordinary people (Raunio 2013, 139; Norocel 2016; Arter 2010, 488–89). The “elite” also constitute the broad yolk of peripheral influences on the political system, as encompassed by Soini’s statement: “book-learned theoreticians, arrogant bureaucrats, cold-hearted technocrats, uncomprehending centralizers, big-money worshippers and smooth avant-garde thinkers do not trust the people. They do not value the people’s views because they believe the people are stupid and indifferent and that all wisdom rests with the experts and an elite that is divorced from everyday life” (cited in Arter 2010, 489). Halla-aho has maintained this anti-elite hostility towards the “old parties” (Raunio 2019, 179) (OTH_POLCLASS = 3).\nPS is also explicitly ethno-centric in its identification of the “people”, more so than the SMP (Arter 2012, 817). While this related to touchstone issues like the teaching of Swedish in schools as a second language and opposition to American television on public airwaves, its primary manifestation was the party’s opposition to immigrants and asylum seekers, against whom the party deployed nativist and welfare chauvinist attitudes (Arter 2010, 499; 2012, 815; Pyrhönen 2013). According to several authors however (Arter 2010, 485; Raunio 2013, 146), the party’s approach to immigration and ethnocentrism is not as extreme as other far-right parties in Europe, and political establishment and EU elites have formed a more important “other” (Niemi 2013). According to Wahlbeck, ethnocentrism in the party’s rhetoric takes the form of defense of the majority more than opposition to a minority (Wahlbeck 2016). Norocel (2016:45) suggests that the precise identity of the party on these matters is complicated by divisions between its agrarian/conservative faction (including former SMP members, and leader Soini) and a more xenophobic, anti-immigrant and far-right one led by Jussi Halla-aho and several of the more controversial members (Norocel 2017, 45; see also Kuisma 2013). There is also some evidence that the party’s stance on these issues has hardened over time (Arter 2010, 498). Under Halla-aho, the party was seen to take a more hard-line anti-immigration views (Borg 2019, 187; Raunio 2019, 176; Arter 2010). While its precise profile is therefore debatable and ambiguous, we’ve coded it 2 on OTH_IMMIGRANTS and 2 on OTH_ETHNIC. Under Soini, and increased OTH_IMMIGRANTS to 3 under Halla-aho’s leadership in 2019.\nPS has been consistently opposed to the EU and builds this opposition into its populist approach (Lähdesmäki 2015). As the party programme once stated: “The EU is a project for filthy rich capitalists which tries to fill the pockets of major owners of capital while creating a valueless Europe where only money matters” (cited in Raunio 2013, 143). Soini dubbed the 2011 election “a referendum on the EU” (Arter 2012, 816). Given the primacy of the EU in the parties identity (especially since the post-bailout 2011 election), this warrants 3 on OTH_FOREIGN.\nPS has a somewhat confusing economic ideology (Kuisma 2013, 94), in that it opposes the bureaucratic red tape of government regulation, yet calls for a strong, interventionist welfare state to safeguard the common citizen against big business and multinationals (OTH_FINANCIAL = 3) (Raunio 2013, 139; see also Arter 2010, 496; 2012, 815). While this could be debated, we have concluded that the party’s ethno-nationalism qualifies it as essentially right-wing (LRPOSITION = R) (Kestilä-Kekkonen and Söderlund 2014, 643). While they call for reforms of democracy, this entails an increase in transparency, and the party does not oppose liberal democratic norms as we are measuring them (Raunio 2013, 140; Arter 2010, 490) (LIBDEMNORMS = 1). The party has been led by Timo Soini until he left in 2017, and was quite dependent on his leadership (Kestilä-Kekkonen and Söderlund 2014; Niemi 2012; 2013). According to Arter, Soini’s presidential candidacy in 2006 was a key source of early publicity for the party, and he acted as its ‘trump card’ ever since (Arter 2010, 488). According to Raunio, Halla-aho was able to keep this leader-centrism going in the 2019 vote (Raunio 2019, 180) (CHARISMA = 3). As the party joined government in 2015, we have labelled it 2 on INSIDER for these elections.\nReferences\nArter, David. 2010. ‘The Breakthrough of Another West European Populist Radical Right Party?

Since the 80’s the party system has been dominated by two parties: the Socialist party (PSOE) and the Right-wing Popular Party (PP). This “bipartidismo” system suffered a crisis due to the financial crisis and the outbreak of numerous corruption scandals. This crisis of representation paved the way for the birth of new parties in 2015 (Podemos and Ciudadanos) and in 2019 (VOX and Mas País) as well as the nationalist conflict in Catalonia."

    "section": "Podemos/ We Can",
    "text": "Podemos/ We Can\nPodemos originated from of the indignados anti-corruption and anti-austerity mass protests. In 2014, a group of university lecturers with no previous political experience led by Leftist Pablo Iglesias created Podemos (We can) (1 in Insider Populism). Both Pablo Iglesias and Iñigo Errejón are academic followers of the work of populist theorists Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe and they very explicitly apply their approach for their political platform (Iglesias, 2014). They employ the term “la casta” to refer to political and economic elites. La casta is “a fundamental component of the political class that runs the country. This is people not representing the citizens but butlers of financial capital. La casta is a minority that rules against the majority’s interests, living in a shameful condition of privilege” (Iglesias, 2014). Against la casta, Podemos wishes to transform the country by redrafting the Constitution in order to establish a real democracy and give power to the people (Briziarelli, 2016). As Iglesias stated:\n\nThere are two groups, the ones above us who live in prosperity and the one below. The one below needs to be aware of its condition, otherwise we are all screwed. Democracy cannot be exercised only every 4 years, with a voting slip [. . .] That is not democracy. Democracy depends on the people, you, going on the streets defending your political power against them. The power is in the people’s hands. If we the people do not exercise it, they will exercise it for us and there is no democracy (Iglesias, 2014).\n\nIn addition to identifying political and economic elites as part of la casta (3 in Political and Financial Class), Podemos has also been a harsh critic of the austerity measures imposed by the EU leaders and has claimed that Spanish politicians are being controlled by foreign powers. For instance, on one occasion he said that “Merkel is very happy with viceroy Mariano Rajoy [President of Spain at the time] who does not obey his citizens but who obeys her. We are going to work to have a government that represents the interests of the citizens and not those of a foreign country” (Iglesias, 2015). I have coded this as 3 in Foreign Interests.\nThe party is very inclusive of immigrants within ‘the people’ supporting universal health coverage for all immigrants and including in their party lists the first Afro-Spanish women to have a seat in parliament (El Mundo, 2015). Moreover, although the party defends a united Spain, it supports holding a referendum of independence in Catalonia and changing the constitution in order to declare Spain ‘plurinational’ (Eldiario.es, 2016) (1 in Immigration and Ethnic Others). As part of its territorial conception of Spain, Podemos engaged in coalitions together with other regional parties and developed regional versions of itself. Sometimes, these regional coalitions ran parallel to Podemos but under a different legal political organization. For the sake of simplicity and following the tradition of political analysis in Spain, Podemos and its coalitions are considered as just one party in the database.\nIn relation to the army, although Iglesias declared that “the military sometimes defends interests they should not defend” he also claimed that “they are an essential component of a democracy and are needed in order to defend the independence and social rights of a country” (Salvados, 2014). Moreover, Podemos included a former Chief of the Defense Staff among his most prominent electoral candidates (1 in Military).\nPodemos could not have been born without the figure of Pablo Iglesias. At the time of the creation of the party, he was a well-known TV guest in political debates and used that popularity in order to launch Podemos by adding his face to the voting list of the party. However, as the party has become more institutionalized over the years and has suffered several divisions within the core group, Iglesias has lost his relevance in favor of other figures such as Irene Montero. I have, thus, coded 3 in Personality dependent on the 2015 and 2016 elections but only 2 in the 2019 elections.\nAlthough Podemos has been a powerful critic of the Spanish media, the party has always defended democratic procedures. The party holds extensive primary elections to select candidates and consults its members to make important choices such as entering in government coalitions or not. Podemos also has a strong anti-corruption program and is highly transparent in its proceedings. Moreover, in relation to the conflict in Catalonia, Podemos has always defended dialogue and criticized both the use of force and the suspension of autonomy of the region. Although some of its criticism of the media in its first years could make it closer to a 2 in LD Norms, I believe that 1 is a more appropriate coding."

    "section": "VOX",
    "text": "VOX\nVOX was formed in 2014 from former members of the Popular Party who were dissatisfied with what they perceived as the party’s lack of ideological definition. The party, led by Santiago Abascal, remained unsuccessful in elections until the 2018 regional elections in Andalucía, when it entered into the regional parliament and enabled a Right-wing government for the first time ever in the region. The party then ran for the 2019 elections in April and again in the repetition of elections in November. According to Turnbull-Dugarte:\n\nVOX is a party with a political ideology firmly grounded in authoritarian conservatism and nationalism. Far from being a single-issue anti-immigrant party (Art, 2011), it advocates policy positions including opposition to same-sex marriage, abortion, gender quotas, gender violence protection ordinances, and general social welfare provision, marking the party’s ideological parity with other Western European radical right-wing parties (Art, 2011; Mudde, 2004, 2007; Norris, 2005). Indeed, its populist approach of promising to “make Spain great again” alongside its nativist authoritarianism signal its fulfilment of Mudde’s (2004) classification as a populist radical right party. Of note in the specific case of Vox, however, is the addition of a strong anti-feminist message (Simón, 2019) brought about in response to recent waves of feminist advancement in Spain as evidenced by the historical 8M demonstrations in 2018. (Turnbull-Dugarte, 2019: 2).\n\nIn a clear reference to Donald Trump, their 2016 electoral manifesto was titled “Make Spain great again” (VOX, 2016). The main enemy of VOX is the current politicians of Spain, as it is clearly stated in their website’s self-description:\n\nVOX […] born to put the institutions at the service of the Spanish, in contrast to the current model that puts the Spanish at the service of politicians. VOX is the commonsense party, which gives voice to what millions of Spaniards think in their homes; the only one that fights against suffocating political correctness. In VOX we do not tell the Spaniards how they have to think, speak or feel, we tell the media and the parties to stop imposing their beliefs on society. Our project is summed up in the defense of Spain, of family and of life; in reducing the size of the State, guaranteeing equality between the Spaniards and expelling the Government from your private life. (VOX, 2014).\n\nVOX, however, does not extend its criticism of the political elites (3 in Political Class) to the economic ones. In fact, VOX defends a very liberal program in economic terms. One of the leaders of VOX said that “we don’t want a large state, the less state, the more freedom for the citizens” (quoted in Antón-Mellón, 2019) and on their website it was possible to read that VOX “believes in a system based on liberty where all taxes are as reduced as possible or even eliminated. Less taxes, more jobs. Less state, more freedom” (quoted in Antón-Mellón, 2019). I have coded 1 in Economic Class.\nVOX also strongly defends of sovereignty against “globalists” and criticizes the rest of the parties for following the dictates of the EU instead of those of the Spanish people (Abascal, 2019). Moreover, Abascal wishes to make Gibraltar part of Spain, attacks the “international oligarchies” and insults Ciudadanos for being “cosmopaletos” or “stupid cosmopolitans” (Abascal, 2019). I have coded 3 in Foreign Interests.\nAbascal has proposed to increase the army’s budget and has included several soldiers as candidates of VOX (El Español, 2019) (1 in Military).\nSantiago Abascal was a low-level politician of the Popular Party in the Basque Country before he decided to leave the party (1 in Insider Populism). He was not well-known outside the Basque Country and he was not even elected first president of VOX. He assumed the role after the first 2014 disastrous elections and the party became relevant through regional elections in Andalucía, of which he was not even a candidate. Therefore, although he is the face of the party, VOX would also have existed without Abascal and its current popularity can hardly be attributed to him (1 in Charisma).\nVOX displays a very strong Spanish nationalism whose main enemy are the pro-independence parties in Catalonia. VOX proposes not only to recentralize the state and eliminate all autonomous regions and their parliaments but also argues for the illegalization of any party that does not defend the unity of Spain (VOX, 2018: 2). Their nationalism is not only about territorial integrity but has an important ethnic component as well. VOX stresses the defense of the Spanish language and wishes to implement a “comprehensive plan for the knowledge, dissemination and protection of national identity and the contribution of Spain to civilization and universal history, with special attention to the deeds and feats of our national heroes” (VOX, 2018: 3).\nIn relation to migration, VOX advocates for the deportation of all illegal immigrants in Spain and of those that are legally in the territory but have committed a felony (VOX, 2018: 5). The party also wishes to “stop the invitation effect” (VOX, 2018: 5) and has repeatedly condemned “multiculturalism” (Abascal, 2019). This anti-immigrant stance is particularly harsh against Muslims: “One of the party’s earliest promotional videos was a spoof news broadcast depicting a veiled woman reporting from outside the mosque-cathedral of Cordoba after an imagined consecration to Islam by a fictional left-wing government (the building was erected during Spain’s Moorish era and was turned into a cathedral in the 13th century). The video ends with the words: ‘Do you want a future like this?’ and doomy music.” (Loucaides, 2018). Thus, I have coded 3 for Ethnic Others and Immigration.\nVOX’s ethnonationalism and proposals to make illegal all parties that do not agree with principles in the Constitution (such as the unity of Spain) are clear violations of prior LD Norms. VOX also argues for the elimination of the Law against gender violence present in Spain since 2004 and to eliminate “radical feminist organisms” (VOX, 2018: 17). However, VOX has not incited violence, nor attacked freedom of the press, nor threatened democratic institutions beyond its ethnonationalism (2 in LD Norms)."

    "text": "Parties not included\nMas País / More Country\nMas País was created from a division within Unidas Podemos led by Íñigo Errejón, former leader of Podemos. Errejón created the party Mas Madrid to ran for president of the regional area of Madrid in April 2019 and, although he was unsuccessful, he decided to form Mas País in order to compete in the national elections on November 2019. Errejón is a scholar on populism and explicitly employs populist rhetoric in his politics, however, he wishes to distinguish himself from the hard-left image of Podemos and he also stresses the green ideology of the party. The party did not achieve the threshold of 5% of the share of the vote to be included in the dataset.\nCiudadanos / Citizens\nCiudadanos (Citizens) was formed in 2006 in Catalonia, and was seen by many as an alternative to the growing Catalan nationalist movements - so much that it was originally seen as a single-issue movement. In later years it has become something very similar to Macron’s En Marche in France - a pro-European, liberal, pro-entrepreneur, anti-corruption, reformist and revival party attracting the attention of the Centre right. The party has been a critic of “bipartidismo” and of the corruption affecting PSOE and PP and is entirely dependent on its charismatic and (very) young leader Albert Rivera.\nNevertheless, the party is not considered populist by any scholar on the topic (Rodríguez Teruel and Barrio, 2016; Rodon and Hierro, 2016; Orriols and Cordero, 2016). Comparing Podemos and Citizens, Lavezzolo and Ramiro (2018: 268) argue that “although both Podemos and Ciudadanos are new parties […] and present themselves as political reformers in clear contrast to the mainstream parties, Podemos is a radical-left populist pro-participatory democracy party […] while Ciudadanos is a centrist one aiming for much more moderate political reforms”. Although the party’s success is the result of the political crisis and the lack of trust in political parties, Ciudadanos’ response can hardly be considered populist.\nDue to the crisis in Catalonia, Ciudadanos has been focusing more on the nationalist elements of its discourse, however, political scientist Lluís Orriols (2018) has argued forcefully against considering this a move towards populist positions. He rejects that Citizens frames politics as elite vs people and argues instead that\nCitizens is a party that broke into Spanish politics to offer a technocratic response to the political crisis. The proposal of Citizens is not to articulate their discourse around returning power to the people but to empower a government of experts in order to achieve the effective and efficient policies that Spaniards (without distinctions) need. With this pedigree of technocratic cut on its backs, it is highly unlikely that Citizens will end up becoming a populist party of the extreme Spanish right. (Orriols, 2018).\nCatalan nationalist parties\nDuring the last elections, Catalan nationalist parties have displayed an anti-establishment and confrontational rhetoric with the Spanish state in which they have combined nationalist claims with populist ones defining ‘the people’ as the Catalan nation (Barrio, 2019; Olivas Osuna, 2019). However, despite their importance in number of seats in the parliament, they do not reach the 5% relevance threshold at the national level.\nReferences\nAbascal S.

    "text": "Populism in Venezuela is mostly linked to Hugo Chávez’s “Bolivarian Revolution”. There are significant differences in the tone, aggressiveness and rhetoric of Chávez before and after winning the 1998 elections, although he defended a similar ideology based on revolutionizing Venezuelan politics, opposing the decadent political regime and combatting neoliberal policies. In a couple of interviews before the election, he assured he would not nationalize any media company, he welcomed foreign investment (Ramos, 1998) and he argued in favor of private ownership of certain industries (tourism, lottery, banking) (Bayly, 1998). According to Scocozza and Colucciello (2016: 29), the real increase in aggressiveness came after winning the election as a way of marking a breaking point with the previous political establishment and particularly after the 2002 failed coup d’état against him. Maduro’s presidency has seen a general deterioration of the political situation in Venezuela, an exacerbation of Chávez’s rhetoric and an intensification in political repression.\nChávez’s initial political rhetoric focused on the idea of revolution, on a symbolic and mythic connection with the heroes of the Venezuelan past, particularly of Bolívar, on constant messages to his Christian values and on the call for a “proceso constituyente”, that is, for the creation of a new constitution that would give power to the people.\nChávez argued forcefully for the creation of a new political era. This was explicitly mentioned in his address to the Congress when debating the new constitution and in his rejection of the previous political system by saying that the “IV Republic was born with the applause of the conservative oligarchy” (Scocozza and Colucciello, 2016: 33). Moreover, Roberts (2012: 145) argues that “Chávez deined the enemy primarily in terms of the political establishment against which he had launched his ill-fated coup attempt in 1992. In particular, he condemned the leaders of AD and COPEI as a corrupt, entrenched, and self-serving political elite that made a farce of representative democracy”. Therefore, Chávez can be coded as number 3 in Political Class throughout all the elections.\nHowever, his classification in left-right axis and against the financial elite is less clear in the 1998 and 2000 election campaigns. Slogans such as “homeland, socialism or death” or “Socialism of the XXI century” did not gain relevance until after the failed coup (Scocozza and Colucciello, 2016: 30). On his first electoral campaign, Chávez was considerably more moderated and drove its inspiration more from nationalism than socialism (Roberts, 2012: 145; Bolívar, 2001: 47). While, on one side, Ellner (2004: 11) and Gates (2010: 3) argue that Chávez was a “staunchly anti-neoliberal” candidate in 1998 and Molina (2002: 231) points out that he based his 2000 campaign on “claims on social division between rich and poor, presenting himself as a friend of the poor and an enemy of the oligarchs”, on the other side, Roberts (2012: 146), drawing on Blanco Muñoz (1998: 611–14), defends that “Chavismo could deine itself in opposition to international capital and globalized neoliberalism, without rejecting capitalism or capitalists per se. Indeed, Chávez came to power advocating a ‘humanistic’ mixed economy that borrowed from both capitalist and socialist development models, with a market freed from monopoly control and a developmentalist state committed to nurturing national producers, both public and private”. In fact, he even rejected the label of “socialist” in favor of “Bolivarian” before the 1998 elections (Bayly, 1998). Nevertheless, since the dataset is thought off as global, in a comparison with other parties throughout the world, it is still possible to code MVR as far-left and opposed to the financial elite. It suffices to point out that it was after the period of 2004 when socialism really became the center of Chávez’s political discourse with the creation of the “New strategic map of the Bolivarian Revolution” (Colmenares, 2011: 11). On the 2012 election, this was clear, for example, when he attacked his political opponent as a “lackey of imperialism” and a “lackey of the bourgeoisie” (Scocozza and Colucciello, 2016: 33).\nImmigration to Venezuela is rarely mentioned in Chavez’s discourses or in academic texts on his politics. In fact, he carried on mass nationalizations of immigrants in 2003 under the project “Misión Identidad”. Thus, he is a 1 in immigration under the Dataset definition (a different issue is Chavez's view on Venezuelan emigration).\nBeing a soldier himself and having created a movement inside the military that preceded his political party (“Movimiento Bolivariano Revolucionario 200” (MBR-200)), Chávez did not associate the military with the elite, in fact, the military was seen as a possible agent of revolutionary change (Colmenares, 2011: 9). In the 2012 election Chávez explicitly praised the military for “being committed, as the working class, with the Bolivarian Constitution” (Scocozza and Colucciello, 2016: 33).\nChávez had nationalism and retrieving popular sovereignty as central axis of his 1998 campaign. He started his inaugural speech with a reference to the “father of the homeland”, Simón Bolívar, that summed up his nationalist discourse: “Blessed is the citizen who, under the coat of arms of his command, summons national sovereignty to exercise his absolute will” (Chávez, 1999). As some authors have stressed, populism in Latin America is “inclusionary” of groups that previously felt excluded such as working class or indigenous citizens and not based on the exclusion of ethnic “aliens” such as European right-wing populism (Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser, 2013). In fact, Chávez stressed constantly his commitment to Americanismo and to Bolívar’s notion of Gran Patria, that is, the vision of a common interest and identity to all Latin American countries (Colmenares, 2011: 9). Chávez repeated constantly his commitment to the improvement of the indigenous communities, however, he did not identify with one particular ethnic group. The 1999 constitution declared Venezuela to be “multiethnic and pluricultural”. Moreover, he did not make this the main axis of his politics, but instead understood the fight for indigenous people as one aspect of the larger struggle between the people and the elite. Taking this into consideration, I have coded 1 for Ethnic others, regions.\nRoberts (2012: 145) has argued that “while Chávez had always been critical of U.S. imperialism and its ties to elite interests in Venezuelan society, he intensified his critique in response to Washington’s thinly veiled support for the military coup that briefly removed him from office in April 2002”. Moreover, in an interview with Bayly (1998), he stresses the desire of collaboration with the IMF and other international institutions. Attending to this criterion, I have coded 2 for foreign interest in the 1998 and 2000 elections and a 3 since the 2006 election.\nChávez was a well-known character in Venezuelan politics before his election in 1998, particularly after his failed coup on 1992. However, he did not hold any office before becoming president. Thus, he is coded as a 1 in Insider Populism in 1998 and a 3 in the rest of elections.\nThere is much debate over the characterization of Venezuela as a democracy or as a dictatorship. Freedom House (2017) considers the country “Partly Free” until 2017, where it becomes “Not Free” and Polity IV (2014) considers it an open anocracy since 2007. Chávez took over the years a series of measures that threatened political pluralism and freedom of the press. He dissolved the opposition-controlled Congress in favor of a Chávez-leaning Constituent Assembly, he extended the powers of the president by weakening checks and balances against the executive branch, the new constitution made no mention to political parties, he replaced many military officials and oil company managers with men close to him, he changed the electoral system to favor his political party and took control over some media companies (Colmenares, 2011: 33; Roberts, 2012). In 2006, the opposition decided not to participate in the elections as a protest against their “undemocratic nature”. However, formally, Venezuela continued to be a democracy and Chávez passed these reforms in several referenda. Although there is a significant difference between measures taken by Chávez and measures taken under Maduro’s government, such as the imprisonment of political opponents like Leopoldo López or Antonio Ledezma, overall, actions taken by both governments can be considered as a radical break with previous liberal democracy norms.\nThere is a clear cult around Hugo Chávez in his movement and he identified directly with the people. He argued repeatedly that “Chávez is not just a man, but that Chávez is a people” (Michelutti, 2017). Nevertheless, the political system before his victory in 1998 showed clear signs of decomposition and all candidates in that election where anti-establishment (Molina, 2002). Thus, it is possible to imagine that another, maybe less successful, Bolivarian movement could have emerged in 1998. After Chávez’s death, there was plenty debate over if Chavismo would survive under Maduro’s leadership, which it has done. However, Maduro draws his support from Chávez’s charisma, and it is perfectly imaginable that another politician could have taken its place."

    "text": "Movement for Socialism\nMovement for Socialism (“Movimiento al Socialismo/MAS”) is a very difficult party to classify. It emerged from a split from the Communist party criticizing harshly its verticality and authoritarianism and defending a deeper democratization of both parties and institutions (Petkoff, 1989b). Moreover, it aimed at the combination of democratic freedoms and social justice (Petkoff, 1989a). Ideologically, it is on the far-left because it seeks the public ownership of the productive system and to control financial elites, but it should be stressed that the party underwent an important de-radicalization compared to the Communist party. I have coded 3 on Financial because, although from Petkoff’s assessment, the party was focused on criticizing political parties, their ideological position accounts for their opposition to the bourgeoisie as the financial elite.\nAlthough it emerges with a clear criticism to the “bipartidism” of the moment, the elites (“cogollos”) and the burocratization of power (Petkoff, 1989b), its main proposal to renovate politics is deepening the democratization of parties and institutions, exemplified by institutionalizing in its own party the existence of diverse tendencies. Petkoff, the presidential candidate in 1983 and 1988, stresses these measures as the real revolution but there is little of the stark distinction between elite and people. In this sense, in the 80s it is closer to non-populist parties that criticize the political system such as Ciudadanos or Macron in Europe than to Podemos. In the presidential elections in the 80s, their candidate won less than 5% of the vote and in the 90s the party supported other candidates. They supported two presidential candidates very far ideologically; Rafael Caldera and Hugo Chávez in the presidential elections of 1993 and 1998, respectively. It is this last election in which we can see a more populist and radical stance (Lalander, 2008), however, this support provoked many divisions and splits within the party between supporters and critics of Chávez. I have coded a 1 for violation of liberal norms due to its stress with democratizing parties and institutions (Petkoff, 1989a) and 1 for Insider Populism because the leaders of the party were known political leaders but held no governmental position."

It was the main party of the opposition to Caldera in the 1993 election and Lalander (2008: 40) points that it was “the party closest to Chávez and that a great number of their militants, union leaders and MPs would later be part of ‘Chavismo’”. Thus, I have coded them in a similar fashion as MVR for the 1993 election and again in the 2000 election in which it was the main party of the opposition in the presidential election. The 2000 election shows the relevance of the populist discourse of Chávez because the candidate of Radical Cause was one of the colleagues of Chávez in the 1992 failed coup d’état.\nThe same is essentially true for Fatherland for all (“Pátria para todos”) and For Social Democracy (“Por la Democracia Social /Podemos”) which are satellite parties of Chávez in the 2005 election which did not wish to become part of his vertical party structure.\nReferences\nAntonio Scocozza and Mariarosaria Colucciello “Política y discurso en América Latina.

    "text": "Progress Party\nThe Progress Party (Fremskrittspartiet, FrP) is the successor to Anders Lange’s Anders Lange’s Party for a Strong Reduction in Taxes, Duties and Public Intervention founded by Anders Lange. in the 1970s. Following Lange’s death the party was renamed the Progress Party and led by Carl Hagen for 28 years until 2006. The party was initially a neo-liberal anti-tax party, but came to focus more on immigration in the 1980s. Progress’s populism has always been seen as somewhat questionable by regional scholars (Jupskas 2013, 205). In particular, the Progress Party invites problematic comparison with its Danish namesake, in part because the two parties have had a very similar chronology and ideological history in their early years. Unlike Danish Progress, under Hagen’s leadership the Progress Party gradually increased its vote share throughout the 1980s and 1990s, and has become a major party in Norway and a member of government since the 2013 elections. After Hagen stepped down from its leadership in favour of Siv Jensen in 2006 Progress became a much more staid part of the party system – a blander and less confrontational liberal party (Bjerkem 2016, 237) – and we don’t consider it populist by our definition from this point.\nIn its early years Progress was concerned mainly with shrinking the state, especially reducing tax rates. Higher rates of immigration in the mid-1980s saw more nativist anti-immigration politics creep into the party platform (causing significant factional conflict) such that this was a core element of the party by the early 1990s (Jupskas 2013, 214; Widfeldt 2000, 491; Bjerkem 2016, 235). According to Hagelund, this began as a kind of welfare chauvinism in line with the party’s dominant neo-liberalism, but gradually morphed into a more sociocultural and nativist form around 1993 (Hagelund 2003, 53). Since the 1990s the party has consistently argued for lower levels of immigration (Jupskas 2013), and housed several controversial anti-immigration politicians from the 1993 election until before the 2001 election, when a group of them were expelled (Hagelund 2003). Hagen himself campaigned on the threat of a Muslim invasion of Norway as early as the 1980s (Betz n.d., 120). However the primacy and position of this kind of socio-cultural politics in the party is debated. Hagen has attempted to distance Progress from other far-right parties in Europe, describing Jean-Marie Le Pen for example as “disgusting, and a pure racist” (Jungar and Jupskås 2014, 228). Given this ambiguity, we have coded OTH_ETHNIC at 2, and OTH_IMMIGRANTS also 2 except for the 1993-1997 elections, when it escalates to 3 on the latter (see Hagelund 2003 for details of this shift). Further research may refine the dates and degrees of this movement.\nOpposition to political elites has always been an important part of Progress’ appeal (Andersen and Bjørklund 1990, 201; Jungar and Jupskås 2014), embodied by slogans like “the party for ordinary people” (Jupskas 2013, 206). The party has been considered equally anti-establishment as other right-wing populist parties in the region (Bjerkem 2016, 236). However it seems that under Hagen’s leadership this was somewhat more tempered than other right-wing populist parties, and I have not found many anti-establishment statements on par with genuine 3s in this category (OTH_POLCLASS = 2). Further research should confirm this. Progress is market-friendly (Jupskas 2013, 216), and does not criticise economic elites (OTH_FINANCIAL = 1), nor does it have a consistent Eurosceptic stance (the party is actually highly divided on the EU question) (OTH_FOREIGN =0).\nHagen’s leadership was evidently important to the party’s political meaning (Widfeldt 2000, 490), however the fact that there have always been factions opposed to him within a fairly robust party organisation make it less personality dominated than other similar parties (Jupskas 2013, 221) (CHARISMA = 2). There is no evidence of any violation of liberal democratic norms (LIBDEMNORMS = 1) and the party was never in government in the period included in this dataset (INSIDER = 1).\nReferences\nAndersen, Jørgen Goul, and Tor Bjørklund. 1990. ‘Structural Change and New Cleavages: The Progress Parties in Denmark and Norway’.

    "text": "People's Movement for Latvia (Seigerists’ Party)\nPeople's Movement for Latvia (Tautas Kustība Latvijai, TKL) was founded in 1994 to contest in the 1995 election. As its semi-formal nickname – Seigerists’ Party – suggests, it was the vehicle of its founder, controversial German-Latvian businessman and former LNNK MP Joaachim Siegerists, “a demagogic populist with a talent for self-advertisement” (Davies & Ozolins, 1996:126). Siegerists, born in Germany, only discovered his Latvian heritage in 1992, at which point he decided to become engaged in the Latvian political scene without even speaking the Latvian language fluently (Nissinen, 1999:137). Despite this, TKL exceeded expectations to win 15% in 1995, before crashing to 1.73 in 1998.\nLike the contemporaneous DPS, the TKL captured the generally frustrated mood of the Latvian electorate with a discourse harshly critical of the political establishment (Pabriks & Štokenberga, 2006:59). Nissinen (1999:139) claims that his rhetoric accused any political rival of being a “communist”, and tended not to discriminate among members of the political establishment (he suggested that 80% of Latvian politicians were “bandits”). The country’s woes had not improved, he claimed, because the old communist elite (the “devil”) were still in power (Nissinen, 1999:139) (OTH_POLCLASS = 3).\nWhile the party was certainly nationalist, the role of ethnocentrism in Siegerists party is difficult to pin down. He had a chequered history of association with far right organisations in Germany, where he was accused of race hatred offences (Davies & Ozolins, 1996:126). He was also on record making a number of anti-Gypsy statements, and Učeň (2007:52) categorises the party xenophobic (although without explanation). Nonetheless, Nissinen convincingly argues that there was not a lot of this in his 1995 platform, even if the media accused of being far-right (1999:139-40). I’ve labelled him 2 on OTH_ETHNIC. There is no evidence for anything registering on the OTH_IMMIGRANT variable. With a generally pro-market neoliberal platform (Nissinen, 1999:136), it did not antagonise the business/wealthy “other” (OTH_FINANCIAL = 1). Likewise, according to Nissinen Siegerists was harchly critical of Russia in his 1993 election, but shifted sharply to support greater ties with Russia by 1995 (OTH_FOREIGN = 1)\nThe party has been called “non-ideological” (Balcere, 2013:95), but was clearly right-wing on both economic policy and nationalist rhetoric (Müller-Rommel and Nørgaard, 2001:31) (LRPOSITION = R). The party is generally seen to be a vehicle for Siegerists’ personality – to the extent that it is often called “Seigerists’ Party” (Davies & Ozolins, 1996:126; see also Pettai and Kreuzer, 1999:156; Nissinen, 1999:136) (CHARISMA = 3). Nissinen (1999:136) goes as far as calling it a “personality cult” due to the synonymy between leader and party. Aside from his flamboyant and controversial personality, his very conventional campaign methods (handing out bananas to would-be voters) received considerable press attention. Učeň (2007:52) categorises as “authoritarian” without explanation, and other than the fact that Seigerists had a generally domineering personality, I can’t see any reason to label the party greater than 1 for LIBDEMNORMS. Niether Siegerists nor his party served in government (INSIDER = 1)"

The party achieved a breakout 15% in those elections and went on to govern in a coalition before collapsing in the subsequent 1998 elections.\nThe party is almost universally described as populist in the literature (see Učeň, 2007:59; Balcere, 2013:95). It campaigned in 1995 on a vaguely anti-corruption, and anti-establishment platform in its breakout 1995 election (Auers, 2013:102), appealing to those who had lost out in the market transitions (Auers & Kasekamp, 2013:239) and victims of a recent major banking collapse (Pettai and Kreuzer, 1999:156). There is not a lot available detailing the nature of the party’s actual populist rhetoric and allegations in 1995, and Nissinen (1999), whose text is most detailed, seems to think that the party’s populism was significantly lighter than the likes of the Seigerists’. Hence I’ve coded it 2 for OTH_POLCLASS.\nThe party has been variously called centre-right (Auers, 2013:88; Nakai, 2014:68), centrist (Stanley, 2017:149; Balcere, 2013:95), and centre left (Nissinen, 1999:146; Gailbreath, 2006:387; Dreifelds, 1996:89). I have placed its LR_POSITION coding at C, but this could be contested. According to Auers & Kasekamp, (2013:239) corrupt businessmen were a target of the party’s populism, although Nissinen (1999:147) claims that the party had significant links with the business class (particularly Russian businesses) (see also Nakai, 2014:68). I have left the OTH_FINANCIAL coding at 2. I’ve seen no evidence to register the party on the OTH_ETHNIC, OTH_FOREIGN or OTH_IMMIGRANTS variables.\nThe party is not discussed in generally leader-centric terms (CHARISMA = 1), or in any way that threatened the democratic order (LIBDEMNORMS = 1). As the party was in a governing coalition from 1995, it is labelled 2 on INSIDER in the subsequent 1998 election."

    "text": "New Era\nNew Era (Jaunais Laiks, JL) was formed in 2001 by the former Central Bank Governor Einārs Repše to compete in the 2002 election. Its anti-corruption rhetoric proved highly successful, with the party winning those elections Einārs Repše becoming Prime Minister for a short period before falling out with coalition partners. The party continued surprisingly well in the next elections without him. It is often seen in similar terms as the contemporaneous Res Publica party in neighbouring Estonia.\nRepše, a popular public figure at the time, claimed to be shocked by the rates of corruption and mismanagement in the political system (Auers, 2002:106; Auers, 2018:352), and accused the country’s incumbent elites of betraying the national interests (Učeň, 2007:59; see also Stanley, 2017:150; Balcere, 2016). As its name suggests, it sold the electorate an idea of “new politics” in which the slate would be wiped clean and a new generation brought in (Sikk, 2009:7) (OTH_POLCLASS = 3). According to Učeň (2007:59-60), the party maintained this anti-political establishment stance even after forming government.\nThe party is usually considered centre-right (Učeň, 2007:59; Nakai, 2014:66) and neo-liberal (Sikk, 2006:133), or occasionally centrist (Auers & Kasekamp, 2013:239). I’ve labelled it CR on LRPOSITION. In accordance with its opposition to corruption, the party styled itself as hostile to “oligarchs” (Auers, 2013:104; Nakai, 2014: 70) – a term which in Latvia refers to wealthy politicians rather than just wealthy citizens (see Auers, 2013:103). Due to this precise meaning it could be argued that the party should be labelled 1 on OTH_FINANCIAL – I have left it at 2 for now. The literature makes no reference to any stances against OTH_ETHNIC, OTH_IMMIGRANTS, OTH_FOREIGN or OTH_MILITARY.\nThe party was generally considered to be based around Repše’s personality (Pabriks & Štokenberga, 2006:58; Sikk, 2006:153), and was able to mobilise successfully without spending very much money (Sikk, 2006:141). As such it has been called a “one-man party” (Sikk, 2004:5) (CHARISMA = 3). However, Repše resigned from its leadership in 2004, and I have therefore dropped this to 1 for 2006. The party did not appear to violate any LIBDEMNORMS. Given that New Era was founded by the former head of the central bank, it would be wrong to label it a 1 on INSIDER even though he was not formally in government, so I’ve placed the party at 2 for its initial election, and 3 afterward (after Respse was Prime Minister)."

    "section": "TB-LNNK/National Alliance",
    "text": "TB-LNNK/National Alliance\nThis entity is a complicated grouping of three separate parties. “For Fatherland and Freedom” (Tēvzemei un Brīvībai/TB) and the Latvian National Independence Movement (Latvijas Nacionāls Neatkarības kustība/LNNK) were separate nationalist parties in the early 1990s that merged in 1997. This party was right wing, and generally ethnocentric in favour of the ethnically Latvian majority, but from the available evidence does not seem to be a populist party (see Galbreath, 2006; and Braghiroli & Petsinis, 2019; Auers & Kasekamp, 2013:239). This could be reviewed however. In 2010, TB-LNNK allied with the far-right youth movement cum political party All for Latvia! (Visu Latvijai!/VL) to form a single list in the elections that year, and a formal party, the National Alliance (NA), in 2011. The VL group had long criticised TB-LNNK for selling out nationalist interests (Auers, 2010:3). According to Auers and Kasekamp, the All for Latvia! Grouping effectively took over the party after the merger. The National Alliance is usually considered Latvia’s first and so far only true populist radical right party, and is often associated with the Estonian People’s Conservative Party (EKRE).\nAccording to Auers (2018: 351), “The VL! Wing of the NA added anti-elite populism to the existing nativism and authoritarianism of TB-LNNK, with VL!s more youthful deputies regularly tweeting and using social media to complain about the older parties’ lack of respect for parliament”. The VL! had achieved this image via a unlimber of well-attended rallies in the 2006 election (when they nonetheless failed to pass the 5% threshold) that offered an “aggressive critique of the political elite” (Auers & Kasekamp, 2013:239). While this suggests a 3 on OTH_POLCLASS, Braghiroli & Petsinis, (2019) suggest that this rhetoric has been checked since entering government after the 2011 elections, and hence I have labelled it 3 for 2010 and 2011 and 2 since then. Further research should clarify this.\nWhile a general ethno-centric stance had been common among ethnic Latvian parties in the immediate post-communist period, the increasing acceptance of multiculturalism allowed the NA to claim that the national elite had abandoned the ethnic majority (Braghiroli & Petsinis, 2019:4). In the NA (and other parties) the most common target of this is the Russian-speaking minority (Jakobson, 2012:47). Among numerous controversial manifestations of this, it supported an annual march of Waffen SS veterans, the limitation of the Russian language in the private sphere (job advertisements for example) (Auers, 2010:5), and commenced its 2011 manifesto with the line that “Latvians must feel at home in their ethnic homeland” (Auers and Kasekamp, 2013:242; see also Bennich-Björkman & Johansson, 2012). There are also credible accusations of anti-Semitism in the party (Auers and Kasekamp, 2013:243) (OTH_ETHNIC = 3). NA is staunchly opposed to refugees (Braghiroli & Petsinis, 2019) (OTH_IMMIGRANT = 3), but this appears to only have become an issue after the 2015 migrant crisis in Europe (see Auers & Kasekam, 2013:241), when Latvia agreed to accept its quota. I have labelled the party 1 on this variable before the crisis. The party is hostile to the influence of both Russia and to a lesser extent the EU (Braghiroli & Petsinis, 2019:6). The party espouses a well-articulated “intermarium” theory that attempts to maintain eastern European culture from threats emanating from both east and west (OTH_FOREIGN = 3). I’ve seen no evidence that the party is opposed to OTH_FINANCIAL (= 1).\nThe party is unambiguously radical right (Auers & Kasekamp, 2013:239) (LRPOSITION = FR), and has violated a number of important democratic norms, particularly by parading in military uniforms and celebrating the memory of controversial pre-war dictator Karlis Ilmanis (Auers & Kasekamp, 2013:243) (LIBDEMNORMS = 3). While backed by a strong and somewhat independent party organisation (the old TB-LNNK), the NA is strongly identified with its young and charismatic leader Raivis Dzintars (Auers & Kasekamp, 2013:240) (CHARISMA = 2). Given that the TB-LNNK was in government in the 1990s, and the NA itself was in coalition government after the 2011 elections, I’ve labelled it 2 on INSIDER."

    "text": "Zatlers Reform Party\nThe (September) 2011 election occurred so soon after the (December) 2010 because incumbent president Valdis Zatlers triggered a clause in the constitution to recall parliament. He did this because he alleged that a trio of oligarchs had taken control of the government: “At the moment we\ncan observe not just theft from state resources but a gradual privatization of Latvian democracy” (cited in Auers, 2013:85). Zatlers went on to form his own party to participate in the election, the “Reform Party” (Reformu partija, RP), a.k.a “Zatler’s Reform Party” (ZRP).\nAs the name and context suggests, the central issue of the party was the endemic corruption of the political class (OTH_POLCLASS = 3). It is a somewhat difficult case because the party alleged that specific parties, not all politicians, were corrupt, so there could be an argument that it shouldn’t feature in the dataset. However, available evidence suggests that the 2011 election called by Zatler “almost exclusively focused around corruption and the illicit influence of the oligarchs” (Auers, 2013:105), and that the party did talk about corruption in “systemic” terms (Jakobson 2012:45). On this basis the party is often considered populist (Auers, 2018:352; Auers & Kasekamp, 2013:245; Jakobson 2012:122). For its anti-oligarch stance, I’ve given it 3 on OTH_FINANCIAL. There is some evidence that the party opposed Russian influence in Latvia (Jakobson, 2012:49), but not to the extent to register on OTH_FOREIGN.\nThe party appears to be centre right (LR_POSITION = CR) but this should be confirmed. The party was based on the personality of Zatler himself (Jakobson et al 2012:) (CHARISMA = 3), and seems not to have threatened democratic norms (LIBDEMNORMS = 1). Zatler was President of Latvia, but given that this position is not the head of government in Latvia, I’ve coded that party 2 on INSIDER."

Nonetheless, NSL picked up 6.8% in the 2014 election, before cratering to less than 1% in 2018. For her anti-oligarch stance I’ve labelled her 2 on OTH_FINANCIAL.\nSudraba is considered by NAME a “charismatic longtime critic of Latvia’s bureaucratic apparatus and political leadership” (Bukovskis & Sprūds) (OTH_POLCLASS = 3).

KPV-LV is another anti-establishment party, founded by independent MP Artuss Kaimiņš, a former actor who became well known for filming parliamentary proceedings and posting them online to show problems in the political system (Balcere, 2016: Auers, 2018:352). The party’s message is that the political establishment – politicians and civil servants – is corrupt and that existing parties waste taxpayers' money (Kaža, 2018; Auers, 2018:352) (OTH_POLCLASS = 3). Recent scandals in the political and banking sectors (Higgins 2018) helped the party surge to second place in the 2018 elections only two years after its foundation, performing particularly well among diasporic communities (Arroque, 2018). It formed coalition government after those elections.\nThe party is moderately anti-EU (Higgins 2018) (OTH_FOREIGN = 2), but, from what I can tell, does not hold many traditionally far-right positions against OTH_ETHNIC and OTH_IMMIGRANTS. Available evidence suggests that it is conservative (LRPOSITION = CR) although it seems somewhat similar to the Five Star Movement in Italy in its deliberately non-ideological identity (Petsinis, 2019), focusing only on hostility to the political class. It is also heavily reliant on Kaimiņš' confrontational personality (Arroque 2018; Kaza 2016; Bukovskis & Sprūds, 2019) (CHARISMA = 3).

    "text": "Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK)\nThe Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Panhellinion Socialistiko Kinema, PASOK) is a left-wing party founded by Andreas Papandreou after the end of the Greek military Junta in 1974. After rapid growth in the late 1970s the party formed government after winning 48.2% in the 1981 elections and was then re-elected with 45.8% in 1985. PASOK has been one of the two major parties (the other being New Democracy) in the Greek party system until that system changed dramatically after the economic crisis in the 2010s.\nWhile the party eventually became a non-populist centre-left party (Papathanassopoulos, Giannouli, and Andreadis 2016, 197; see also Fouskas 1998), it is usually considered to have practiced a kind of populism in the 1970s and 1980s. That said, deciding when to include the party is a difficult question, and some comparative populism scholars (Van Kessel 2015) have chosen to avoid it altogether. On the balance of evidence of its 1980s rhetoric, we’ve included the party for the 1981, 1985, 1989 (x2) and 1990 elections, but following Lyrintzis (Lyrintzis 2005, 248, 250) and Spourdalakis and Tassis (Spourdalakis and Tassis 2006, 499) it seems that the party adopted a much more moderate “modernising” discourse by the 1993 election, after which its original populism never returned. Katsambekis & Stavrakakis date this transition to the “early 1990s” (Katsambekis and Stavrakakis 2017, 391).\nAt its foundation in the 1970s, PASOK was an anti-systemic” “protest” party (Moschonas 2001, 12) Rather than appealing to one particular social class (as the Greek communist party did), PASOK appealed to a broad and vague category of “non-privileged” (Mavrogordatos 1984, 160): by which it meant “farmers, workers, employees, craftsmen and artisans, the youth and all the people who are subject to odious exploitation by modern monopoly capital, local as well as foreign” (cited in Lyrintzis 1984, 111). Conversely, the “privileged”/“establishment” were represented as an “oligopoly” consisting of local and foreign forces (Lyrintzis 1984, 668; Mavrogordatos 1984, 160; Katsambekis and Stavrakakis 2017, 396), including the former Junta and the political “right” – byword for the party’s political enemies (Pappas and Aslanidis 2015) (OTH_POLCLASS = 3) (OTH_FINANCIAL = 3).\nPASOK made the “foreign factor” – imperialism and foreign capital – the enemy (Lyrintzis 1984, 111; Moschonas 2001, 12; Markou 2017, 65–66) in its populism, and used nationalistic statements like “Greece belongs to the Greeks” (Papathanassopoulos, Giannouli, and Andreadis 2016, 197). This rhetoric was positioned in a well-developed narrative relating to the underdevelopment of peripheral and post-colonial states in the world economy (Pappas and Aslanidis 2015, 183). It was initially opposed to membership in the EEC, although this softened in its first term in office and by 1985 it was pro accession (Moschonas 2001, 12). These sentiments gave the party’s discourse a strong degree of nationalism (OTH_FOREIGN =3). There is no evidence of anything that would register on the OTH_ETHNIC, OTH_IMMIGRANTS and OTH_MILITARY variables (all = 1).\nWhile unambiguously left wing at its outset (Lyrintzis 1984, 111), PASOK has both drifted to the centre and engaged in ideological vagueness (Lyrintzis 1987, 667) in its program. We’ve coded the party’s LRPOSITION as L in its first two elections and CL after its embrace of austerity following the 1985 election. The party was never internally democratic, and “the personality and charisma of Papandreou influenced powerfully its development and nature” (Lyrintzis 1984, 111–12, 114; see also 1987, 668; Mavrogordatos 1984, 160; Pappas 2014, 9–10) (CHARISMA = 3). We have coded it 3 on INSIDER after the 1981 election, before which it was a 2, as Papandreou had served in senior positions in the government in the 1960s).\nAccording to Pappas and Aslanidis, (Pappas and Aslanidis 2015, 185) “Successive PASOK governments developed an ever-growing disrespect for political liberalism and its institutions, which, as the current logic went, could be compromised, impaired, or otherwise twisted as long as it was in favour of realising popular supremacy. Following that logic, institution building ceased to be a priority, and an understanding of institutions as means of achieving the gratification of the people was put firmly in place.” Although we’ve seen no evidence that this reached the level of a critical threat to democracy itself, we’ve coded the party 2 on LIBDEMNORMS."

    "text": "The Popular Orthodox Rally (LAOS)\nThe Popular Orthodox Rally (Laikos Orthodoxos Synagermos, LAOS) was an ultra-nationalist party founded in 2000 by George Karatzaferis, a renegade journalist former member of the centre-right New Democracy (ND) party. It launched amid a controversy relating to the PASOK government’s removal of religious affiliation from Greek national identity cards, a move strongly opposed by the Orthodox Church. The party only breached the 5% mark in the 2009 election, before collapsing totally after its support for the unpopular bailout in 2011, after which most of its key politicians were absorbed into ND.\nLAOS engaged in anti-establishment politics, accusing the “rotten establishment” of both PASOK and ND (the two dominant parties at the time) of enslaving the country to its enemies (Ellinas 2012, 131; Katsambekis and Stavrakakis 2017, 399; Verney 2004, 21). Unlike “all the others” in the political sphere, LAOS stressed its own absolute fidelity to “the people” in classically populist terms (Pappas and Aslanidis 2015, 186) (the word “laos” even means “people” in Greek). While this clearly suggests an OTH_POLCLASS coding of 3, according to Katsambekis & Stavrakakis, (Katsambekis and Stavrakakis 2017, 400) LAOS engaged in an office-seeking strategy to win power in 2009 (the only election included in the dataset), employing a much softer rhetoric against the other parties. On this basis we’ve coded it 2 for the 2009 election, however this should be reviewed. In advancing nationalist claims about the people’s sovereignty, opposition to foreign influence in a number of forms was particularly relevant to LAOS. The party suggested that PASOK and ND were overly-deferential to the US (Ellinas, 2012:130), and was uncompromisingly critical of other traditional foreign enemies of Greece such as Turkey and F.Y.R Macedonia (Ellinas 2012, 130; Bistis 2013, 38) (OTH_FOREIGN = 3).\nLAOS also constructed “the people” and their “others” in explicitly ethnocentric and religiously sectarian terms (Georgiadou 2013, 83; Katsambekis and Stavrakakis 2017, 399). As its name suggests, it presented itself as the political wing of the Orthodox Church (particularly of its leader Archbishop Christodoulos, who was something of a populist in his own right) (Papastathis 2015, 233). Antisemitism was one of its recurring themes in this regard, with Karatzaferis suggesting in 2000 that Greece was “run by Jews” (Ellinas 2012, 130). It also practiced a strong hostility toward Muslims (Ellinas 2012, 130; Lazaridis and Tsagkroni 2016, 211) (OTH_ETHNIC = 3). It was also strongly opposed to immigration, proposing to use state funds to resettle immigrants back in their home countries (Lazaridis and Tsagkroni 2016, 207; Doxiadis and Matsaganis 2012, 53; Papathanassopoulos, Giannouli, and Andreadis 2016, 207; Katsambekis and Stavrakakis 2017, 399) (OTH_IMMIGRANTS = 3).\nIt is universally considered to be far right in the literature (Doxiadis and Matsaganis 2012, 53; Lazaridis and Tsagkroni 2016; Bistis 2013) even though it has included some more moderate members of the right and exhibited a degree of ideological “ambiguity” (Georgiadou 2013, 84) (LRPOSITION = FR). Key to this ambiguity was its approach to welfare policy and attacks on the financial elite. While LAOS had been generally free-market and a proponent of lower tax cuts, by the 2009 election the party dropped its tax liberalism (Bistis 2013, 39), and according to Ellinas, (Ellinas 2012, 131) “LAOS makes a significant effort to appeal to leftist voters, especially low-earning workers, through fierce populist attacks on globalization, foreign chains and commercial banks” (see also Georgiadou 2013, 83). Karatzaferis actually considered his party left-wing on social issues, and used his first speech in Parliament to declare that “Bankers are thieves, Mr Prime Minister, and you must send the attorney in to check on them” (cited in Ellinas 2012, 131) (OTH_FINANCIAL = 3).\nThere can be little doubt that the personal charisma of Karatzaferis was essential to the party’s identity, and that it was build on a generally “personalistic structure” (Dinas 2008, 605) (CHARISMA = 3), and although he was an ND MP before founding the party, this level of power should not escalate the party to a 2 on INSIDER (= 1). The party is difficult to code on LIBDEMNORMS: its character seems of a keeping with illiberal far-right parties in Europe, but we’ve seen no evidence in the secondary literature that it practiced any violence (this absense is inferred by Roushas 2014, 10), or showed particular hostility to liberal state institutions that could be considered a threat to liberal democratic norms, and hence we’ve coded it 1 for now."

    "section": "The Independent Greeks (ANEL)",
    "text": "The Independent Greeks (ANEL)\nIndependent Greeks (Anexartitoi Ellines, ANEL) was a right-wing populist party led by Panos Kammenos, who – similar to Karatzaferis and LAOS – split from ND to form the party in 2012. It rose to prominence after opposing the 2012 bailout (which LAOS supported), drawing on nationalist themes to poll 10.6% in the 2012 elections. After this success it joined an unlikely “populist coalition” with Syriza, with which it was in government until 2019, when it withdrew due to disagreements over the Macedonian naming compromise. It did not participate in the 2019 elections.\nIn the context of the financial crisis, Kammenos accused the whole political class of corruption and disloyalty to the people, asserting that the major parties are involved in a decades-old “pact” to hand the wealth of the country to foreign forces (Pappas and Aslanidis 2015, 192; Doxiadis and Matsaganis 2012, 79). Both major parties (PASOK and ND) were considered “traitors” and “conspirators” for their willingness to comply with the austerity demands of the “troika” (Katsambekis and Stavrakakis 2017, 401; see also Aslanidis and Rovira Kaltwasser 2016, 1081) (OTH_POLCLASS = 3).\nIn typically nationalist terms, ANEL’s most important “others” were foreign entities. It alleged that there was a “New World Order” controlling Greece, and that national politicians are complicit wilfully surrendering national sovereignty to it (Pappas and Aslanidis 2015, 192). Accordingly, the party suggested that the financial crisis was artificially induced by foreign actors (with PM Papandreou acting as a willing agent) and that the bailout was a way for those actors to steal Greece’s wealth (Pappas and Aslanidis 2015, 192). Anti-German sentiment was particularly strong, as ANEL accused Chancellor Merkel of imposing a “4th Reich” on Greece via its austerity demands (Papathanassopoulos, Giannouli, and Andreadis 2016, 200). Kammenos also engaged in anti-American rhetoric, while stressing the “Orthodox bonds” Greece had with Russia (Petsinis 2016, 286, 288). In the context of this foreign assault, ANEL claims to fight for national sovereignty (Fielitz 2018, 2) (OTH_FOREIGN = 3).\nANEL’s narrative of “the people” is constructed in mainly ethnic terms (Papathanassopoulos, Giannouli, and Andreadis 2016), and the party has engaged in racist and anti-Semitic rhetoric (Aslanidis and Rovira Kaltwasser 2016, 1081) (OTH_ETHNIC = 3). Its discourse was also\nstrongly hostile to immigrants (Ellinas 2013, 558), who were alleged to have been sent by the New World Order to harm the country (Pappas and Aslanidis 2015, 193), and who constituted a threat to the Greek ethnos (Fielitz 2018, 15) (OTH_IMMIGRANTS = 3).\nANEL’s economic policy had strong elements of state interventionism (Katsambekis and Stavrakakis 2017, 401), but is always considered in the literature to be either right-wing (Stavrakakis, Andreadis, and Katsambekis 2017, 450; Vasilopoulou and Halikiopoulou 2013, 529) or far/extreme/radical right (Lazaridis and Tsagkroni 2016, 210; Aslanidis and Rovira Kaltwasser 2016; Fielitz 2018). It is likely the case that the former designation is a product of implicit comparisons with the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn, and that by global or regional standards it is a typically far right party (LRPOSITION = FR). The party’s OTH_FINANCIAL rhetoric in the context of the financial crisis was clearly strong, and even though this was tied up with its OTH_FOREIGN discourse, its references to “loan sharks who have enslaved the nation” (cited in Vasilopoulou and Halikiopoulou 2013, 533) earn it a 3 on this variable.\nANEL is clearly a “leader-centric” party that revolves around Kammenos (Pappas and Aslanidis 2015, 192; Stavrakakis, Andreadis, and Katsambekis 2017, 457), who monopolises its representation in the media (Fielitz 2018, 16) (CHARISMA = 3). According to Pappas & Aslanidis (Pappas and Aslanidis 2015, 192) it was not characterised by violent tendencies. However aspects of rhetoric – declaring that the 2012 election was not a “democratic process” but rather “we are dealing with occupation troops which violate democracy” (Pappas and Aslanidis 2015, 193) – and immigration policy – its policy that illegal immigrants be placed in maximum security detention, (Lazaridis and Tsagkroni 2016, 209) – justify a 2 coding on LIBDEMNORMS, although this should be confirmed. Kammenos was not powerful enough in ND to be considered an INSIDER by the time of the 2012 election (= 1)."

    "text": "Golden Dawn\n“People’s Association – Golden Dawn” (Chrysi Avgi, GD) is a fascist and nationalist movement started in 1983 by Nikos Michaloliokos. After two decades flying under the radar it achieved a breakthrough in the 2010 local elections, when Michaloliokos won a seat on the Athens city council. Following this GD’s national vote spiked at 6.92% in the 2013 elections – conducted in the heat of the economic crisis – and remained constant through the 2015 votes (6.3%, 7.0%) before collapsing to below 3% in 2019. Due to its extremism some scholars do not consider the party populist, particularly those who see populism and fascism as exclusive categories (Katsambekis and Stavrakakis 2017, 404; Stavrakakis, Andreadis, and Katsambekis 2017, 450).\nGD’s political discourse is highly critical of the political “establishment” (Pappas and Aslanidis 2015, 202), and it frequently called “anti-system” (Roushas 2014, 5; Ellinas 2015, 4). It considers non GD politicians “thieves” functioning in only a “pseudo democracy” – prosecutions of GD members are attributed to the “conspiracy” of these established forces (cited in Ellinas 2015, 4; see also Koronaiou and Sakellariou 2013, 337) (OTH_POLCLASS = 3). It is explicitly racist, calling for a state which is homogenous on the lines of “race, blood and ancestry” (Georgiadou 2013, 88; Pappas and Aslanidis 2015, 200; Ellinas 2013, 549). Party leadership has repeatedly disputed the “Greekness” of citizens who are not ethnically Greek (Ellinas 2015, 5), and the party refers to ethnically Greek citizens as “the people” (Kyriazi 2016; Stavrakakis, Andreadis, and Katsambekis 2017, 450). It is also deeply anti-Semitic, attributing the ills of both capitalism and communism to the forces of international “Zionism” (Koronaiou and Sakellariou 2013, 336) (OTH_ETHNIC = 3). Relatedly, GD is sharply hostile to immigrants, associating them with crime and unemployment and advocating for their forced expulsion from the country (Pappas and Aslanidis 2015, 200; Bistis 2013, 47; Roushas 2014; Ellinas 2015, 4). It also accused the “parties of the establishment of the so-called left” of pursuing high rates of immigration in order to achieve a “demographic alteration” of the Greek nation (Ellinas 2013, 549), and cultural “genocide” (Kyriazi 2016, 2532) (OTH_IMMIGRANTS = 3).\nGD has also adopted a strong degree of “anti-plutocratic” discourse against multinational business and neo-liberal capitalism (Ellinas 2013, 550), which it associates with Zionism (Koronaiou and Sakellariou 2013, 335). Some scholars have suggested that the party’s food drives to unemployed (and ethnically Greek) citizens developed a kind of “Robin Hood” image (Bistis 2013, 49; see also Koronaiou and Sakellariou 2013) (OTH_FINANCIAL = 3). GD accuses the establishment of being controlled by foreign forces at the expense of national sovereignty (Ellinas 2013, 551), and refers to the 2010 memorandum signed between the government and foreign debt holds the “ethnocide Memorandum” (Lazaridis and Tsagkroni 2016, 213). It also makes irredentist claims against Albania, and is sharply opposed to accepting the name “Macdedonia” in any form in North Macedonia (Ellinas 2013, 551). It is also hostile to the EU and opposed to “American Zionism” (Ellinas 2015, 4) (OTH_FOREIGN = 3).\nDespite its somewhat left wing economic policies (such as higher taxes on businesses and opposition to privatisations (see Roushas 2014, 19–20), GD is universally considered radical/extreme right in the literature (LRPOSITION = FR). According to Ellinas (Ellinas 2013, 552), GD is totally controlled and defined by the “towering presence” of Michaloliokos, whose hierarchical leadership is embedded in military-like hierarchies (Dinas et al. 2016, 81) (CHARISMA = 3). GD has a strong paramilitary presence, and its members have engaged in violence against immigrants and leftists for decades (Georgiadou 2013, 87–88; Pappas and Aslanidis 2015, 200; Ellinas 2013, 548; Bistis 2013, 44–45; Doxiadis and Matsaganis 2012, 55). Among numerous examples, party MPs have assaulted political rivals on television, party vigilantes have engaged in ‘cleansing’ operations to attack dark-skinned merchants in market places, and party documentation asks members to reject the authority of Parliament (Ellinas 2013, 549–50). Michaloliokos has also defended the legitimacy of the right-wing military Junta that ruled Greece 1967-74 (Bistis 2013, 51; Roushas 2014, 8). It is also hostile to media scrutiny, with Michaloliokos once accusing a TV interviewer of “taking orders from the New York Times and international Zionism (cited in Ellinas 2013, 550). Due to these features the party should be considered highly authoritarian to the extent that it is a direct threat to democracy itself (LIBDEMNORMS = 3). Neither Michaloliokos nor the party have ever been in government (INSIDER = 1)."

    "text": "Coalition of the Radical Left (SYRIZA)\nThe Coalition of the Radical Left (Synaspismós Rizospastikís Aristerás, SYRIZA) is a grouping of minor non-communist left-wing parties that in various forms sat on the fringes of Greek politics throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. It vaulted into the mainstream on the back of mass protests (the “movement of the squares” or “aganaktismenoi”) against austerity measures imposed by emergency lenders following the 2010 debt crisis. Following a dramatic climb to 26.6% in the (June) 2012 elections, SYRIZA became the formal opposition party, and then after polling 36.3% in 2015 formed a coalition government with ANEL. While this coalition of opposing forms of populism was surprisingly stable, by the 2019 vote SYRIZA’s support had declined to 31.5%, and it lost government. Given that SYRIZA did a significant about-turn by accepting the bailout conditions in 2015, there would seem to be a strong case that the party might have dropped or changed its populist rhetoric toward the 2019 elections. The available evidence suggests however that Tsipras’ discourse and the people’s “enemies” remained unchanged (Markou 2017, 6).\nIn the context of the Greek financial crisis, SYRYZA’s populist discourse melded the political class, the business elite, and foreign actors into one “other” (Papathanassopoulos, Giannouli, and Andreadis 2016, 198). The party referred to the “establishment” of political parties including PASOK, ND, LAOS and DIMAR (Stavrakakis and Katsambekis 2014, 129–30; Markou 2017, 62) and the diaploki – the network of political and business elites (Pappas and Aslanidis 2015, 194). In 2012 the party campaigned in typically populist Manichean terms against “an almighty authority of the triangle of sin, which has the corrupt bipartisan political system on its top corner, the bankers on the other, and the interweaving media on the third”, declaring that “It’s either Them or Us” (cited in Pappas and Aslanidis 2015, 194; see also Tsakatika 2016, 528; Markou 2017, 62) (OTH_POLCLASS = 3).\nSYRIZA’s version of “the people” is put in material rather than ethnic terms, and one of their enemies are the “oligarchs” (Pappas and Aslanidis 2015, 194; Papathanassopoulos, Giannouli, and Andreadis 2016, 199; Katsambekis 2015, 154), declaring during the 2012 election campaign that the race was a battle “Between the Greece of the Oligarchy and the Greece of Democracy” (Stavrakakis and Katsambekis 2014, 128). In this context the Memorandum was seen as a way for “oligarchs” to “increase their wealth and privileges” (Pappas and Aslanidis 2015, 194), and the party portrayed the political sphere as divided between pro-memorandum and anti-memorandum forces that aligned with the elite and the people respectively (Katsambekis 2015, 156) (OTH_FINANCIAL = 3). Tsipras declared himself the successor of Papandreou’s original PASOK, whose principles the current PASOK leadership had abandoned (Pappas and Aslanidis 2015, 194).\nThe Troika of European debt holders (The European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund) were a constant “enemy” of the people in SYRIZA’s discourse, and the division of “external troika” and “internal troika” was used to denote those domestic political forces which were alleged to be acting as lackeys of the foreign forces (Stavrakakis and Katsambekis 2014, 131; Tsakatika 2016, 528). In 2012 the WWII themes of a Nazi “4th Reich” – in common with ANEL – were strong in SYRIZA’s discourse against German domination of Europe (Pappas and Aslanidis 2015, 193), and the party portrayed a lineage the anti-Nazi resistance group the National Liberation Front (Tsakatika 2016, 528). Given that this anti-foreign discourse relied on the context of the memorandum, we’ve coded it 1 on OTH_FOREIGN in 2007 and 3 from 2012 on. SYRIZA’s version of the “people” and their “others” are also non-ethnic (Stavrakakis and Katsambekis 2014; Markou 2017, 63) (OTH_ETHNIC = 1), and its rhetoric was largely pro-immigrant (Katsambekis and Stavrakakis 2017, 400–401; Markou 2017, 63; Mudde 2016, 35) (OTH_IMMIGRANTS = 1).\nAs its name suggests, the party is unambiguously left wing (LRPOSITION = FL). It is an open question whether the party should carry this label through to the 2019 election, when it had arguably watered down its radical identity. Given that the party was a fairly well-structured coalition of parties before its rapid ascendance in 2012, and the fact that this ascendance was driven by a somewhat organic relationship with the popular protests of the 2010-12 period and earlier (Katsambekis 2016, 394–95), there doesn’t seem to be a good case to be made that it relied on the leadership of Tsipras in the 2012 election. However, according to Tsakatika, Syriza’s campaigns increasingly focused “on his person” (Tsakatika 2016, 532), and other scholars have mentioned that the leader’s personality became increasingly important to its identity over time (Pappas 2016; Mudde 2016, 9, 28, 31) (CHARISMA = 1 in 2007-12, 2 2015-19). As the party was clearly not in power before its 2015 election victory, it is coded 1 on INSIDER before that election and 3 after.\nRegarding LIBDEMNORMS, there is little to place the party above 1 in its early elections. However several actions that it undertook in government lead some scholars to claim that the party was a mild threat to liberal institutional norms. Examples of this are its such as pushing for the prosecution of statistician Andreas Georgio whom it accused of sabotaging the national debt figures in 2009 and the alleged use of state media to pursue the party’s agenda (Aslanidis and Rovira Kaltwasser 2016, 1082; Iosifidis and Papathanassopoulos 2019; Karaliotas 2021). While this should be further studied, we don’t think this quite reaches the level of 2 on LIBDEMNORMS, and therefore we’ve coded it 1 throughout its time in the dataset."

    "text": "Japan Restoration Party/ Japan Innovation Party\nThe only national party that could be considered populist by the dataset’s standards is the Japan Restoration Party (Nippon Ishin no Kai, JRP). JRP was is the national successor to the Osaka Restoration Party (Osaka Ishin no Kai, also translated “One Osaka Party”) (Jou 2015), both built around then Mayor of Osaka and former Governor of Osaka Prefecture, Tōru Hashimoto. Hashimoto is a former television personality and lawyer who split from the dominant Liberal Democratic Party to run successfully for Governor in 2007. ORP was a regionalist party with a neoliberal reformist agenda. As his national brand grew, he created the JRO as a merger of the ORP with the nationalist Sunrise Movement of Tokyo Governor Shintarou Ishihara before the 2012 election. While Ishihara was technically the leader of the national party, most analyses seem to consider Hashimoto to have been the “face of the party during the election” (R. J. Pekkanen and Reed 2016, 66), and the continuity of the Ishin name suggests as much. The party did surprisingly well, leading some to consider it a brief “third force” in Japanese politics (Komatsu 2017, 165). Note that the English name “restoration” was chosen by the party, but Ishin actually means “innovation” in Japanese (Kobori 2013, 108), and some literature refers to the party as the Japanese Innovation Party. To complicate matters, when Hashimoto pulled his faction out of the JRF following strategic disputes with Ishihara’s Tokyo wing of the party, the new party he founded was called the “Japan Innovation Party” (JIP) (Fahey et al. 2021, 319). This party stood in the subsequent 2014 elections, and although a new party, evidence suggests that Hashimoto absorbed the newly merged faction into his own operation more than vice versa, and hence we’ve considered it a continuation of the JRP in the dataset (except on CHARISMA, as discussed below). Hashimoto’s popularity declined following the 2014 election, and after his signature policy of uniting Osaka prefecture and Osaka city was defeated in a referendum in 2015, he announced he would leave politics.\nHashimoto’s populism was rooted in his harsh and acerbic criticism of the political class. His primary antagonists in this regard were national political parties, bureaucrats, and unions (Jou 2015, 149), as well as local councils and academics (Yoshida, 2019:3). His success was due to the “theatrical” (Klein 2015, 3) way in which he berated his opponents with “sometimes-violent criticisms” (Yoshida 2020, 3) “especially before television crews” (Weathers 2014, 82) and on social media (Fahey et al. 2021, 327). This rhetoric accused government employees (probably his main “other”) of not caring about their jobs (Weathers 2014, 82), of being overpaid (Kobori 2013, 112), and of being “termites of public finance” (Pons 2012). Further to these insults, he repeatedly claimed or implied that public servants actively and intentionally maintained the status quo for their own material interest (Kobori 2013, 112; Ichihara 2021, 92). Likewise, he claimed that politicians in the major parties were untrustworthy, suggesting before the 2011 Osaka Prefecture elections, for example, that “We can’t entrust things to Diet politicians. Isn’t it only the people of Osaka Prefecture who can get this country moving?” (Weathers 2014, 84). In 2012 he campaigned on the slogan “If you are fed up with the two major parties, vote JRP” (Reed 2013, 81). This anti-politician message has led many observers to consider him and the JRP “anti-establishment” (Lindgren 2015, 577). In Fahey’s words, Hashimoto “depicted politics as a good-versus-evil struggle between his reforms and the entrenched, self-serving bureaucrats and public servants,” (Fahey et al. 2021, 327). (OTH_POLCLASS = 3).\nThe party’s key ideological hallmarks were nationalism (Horiuchi 2014, 29; Jou 2015, 156) and neoliberalism (Weathers 2014; Lindgren 2015), due to which it is usually considered to be right wing (Kobori 2013, 117; Chiavacci 2022, 127) (LRPOSITION = R). Other than the political class and state bureaucrats, other “others” in Hashimoto’s and the JRP’s discourse are somewhat more difficult to clarify. His nationalism was not “hard core” in the mould of Ishihara (Horiuchi 2014, 29), but by the time of the 2012 election the JRP was clearly a hawkish anti-China party which mobilised heavily around the sensitive Senkaku Islands issue (Horiuchi 2014, 33). However, we have seen no evidence that the party accused domestic rivals of being loyal to these foreign powers, and hence we’ve coded it 2 on OTH_FOREIGN.\nLikewise, while some scholars have suggested that Hashimoto was something of a nativist (Lindgren 2015, 586), others have stressed that “despite his embrace of many nationalist views, Hashimoto strongly opposed xenophobic movements” (Fahey et al. 2021, 328–29). While he probably deserves a 1 on the OTH_ETHNIC and OTH_IMMIGRANT variables in his own right, JRP’s coding is complicated by its amalgamation with Ishihara’s hard right sunrise movement, which was known for harsher nativist rhetoric in this regard (Lindgren 2015). Owing to this we’ve coded the JRP 2 on both scales for 2012, but this could be revisited. Given that the JIP did not include Ishihara, we’ve reduced these variables to 1 in the 2014 election. JRP was clearly “pro-business” (Yoshida 2020, 3; see also Jou 2015, 150) and did not show any major hostility to the wealthy (OTH_FINANCIAL = 1) or the military (OTH_MILITARY = 1).\nThe ORP was clearly a “leader-defined party” (Jou 2015, 145). Numerous sources note that Hashimoto’s “aggressive and impatient political style” made him Japan’s “most popular politician” in 2012 (Weathers 2014, 77; see also Fahey et al. 2021, 327), and that he was notably “charismatic” (Horiuchi 2014, 29). However, the JRP being a merger with the Sunrise party again complicated the coding here for the 2012 election. Jou claims that this co-leadership model means that JRP cannot truly be considered a truly leader-defined party, even though Hashimoto’s charisma was a key reason why voters supported it (Jou 2015). Conversely, Reed (Reed 2013, 72) claims that the party didn’t really have a coherent policy profile, and that “personality” was a dominant reason why most of its voters supported it. While there may be a case to code it 2 on CHARISMA, we’ve coded it 3. However once the JIP formed for the 2014 election, Pekkanen and Reed suggest that it was new partner Kenji Eda, not Hashimoto, who was the “face of the party durin the election” R. J. Pekkanen and Reed 2016, 69), and hence we’ve reduced CHARISMA to 1 for that vote. Hashimoto was not a figure in previous national governments at the time of the 2012 or 2014 elections (INSIDER = 1).\nHashimoto pushed Japanese liberal democratic norms in several ways. Ideologically, he advocated what he called a “decisionist” ideal of political control (Kobori 2013, 114), where elected leaders (like him) would not be as constrained by checks on their power (Fahey et al. 2021, 327). “His distaste for institutions that limit executive power was clear” claims Fahey (Fahey et al. 2021, 327). On 30 June 2011, he notoriously said, “the most important thing in Japanese politics is dictatorship” (Kobori 2013, 114). He also abused the rights of government employees in Osaka by subjecting them to full body searches for tattoos (Kobori 2013, 113; Fahey et al. 2021, 328), and attempting to force them to complete a non-anonymised questionnaire about their political affiliations and activities (Kobori 2013, 112). In addition not this he aggressively denounced media outlets critical of this administration (Fahey et al. 2021, 327; Yamakoshi 2019, 12). All of this led him to labelled “hashizumu” by some critics – a portmanteau of his name and fashizumu (fascism) (Weathers 2014, 83). While this is clearly evidence of threats to liberal democratic norms, we don’t feel that it quite rises to 3 on the LIBDEMNORMS scale (= 2).\nNot included\nThe nature of the Japanese Socialist Party (JPA) is not really populist, and the same can be said of the Japanese Communist Party (JCP). Like other socialist parties worldwide, their platform is predominantly ideological and issues-based, even if they imply a kind of anti-elitism in their economic policy. In the case of the JPA, the two issues that are arguably its raison d'etre are the evils of free-market capitalism and militarism. The party did dilute its socialist rhetoric as time went on, however, dropping its comittment to socialist revolution in 1989. But this was more acquiesence to the political estabilishment than response to some bubbling populist sentiment. The JCP, on the other hand, has remained steadfastly ideological. It did express willingness in 2016 to form a coalition with the Democratic Party to challenge the dominance of the LDP/Kometio coalition, but the leader of the DP rejected the possiblity due to the JCP being too far left.\nThe growth of the Democratic Party through the 2000s into government in 2009 has been called populist by some, but this is only really so because of how staid and conservative Japanese politics is generally under LDP dominant part rule. Several actors within the long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) have been considered populist. The first is Jun'ichiro Koizumi emerged at a time when severe economic downturn reduced the public's faith in the political establishment and the bureaucracy (Kato 2018). He ran on a neo-liberal reformist platform (advocating privatisations of key sectors) and assailing the more patrimonial bosses in the LDP, against whom he commanded deep member-based support. While Koizumi often used terms that might be considered populist, and occasionally hit touchstone nationalist issues (like visiting the Yasukuni shrine), his style seems to have more in common with a Ronald Reagan-style outsider politician reformer (Otake 2009; Fahey et al. 2021), and not a populist as we define the term. According to Otake, he avoided “highly inflammatory” rhetoric while criticising his opponents (cited in Weathers 2014, 82), contrasting him with populists like Hashimoto and Ishihara. Likewise, Koizumi's successor Shinzo Abe has a strong nationalist streak similar to far-right populist parties, but not one that could render him or the LDP categorically populist under his leadership. Interestingly, it seems that Abe's ability to command this nationalist flank is the reason why far right groups don't get much traction, even though several very small ones have emerged of late. The Komeito Party (both the original and the New Komeito) is tough to code because it defies conventional party typologies. There is a case to consider it a populist party because its mantra is the representation of “common people”, there’s no evidence that it engages in anti-elite rhetoric.\nReferences\nChiavacci, David. 2022. “Social Change in Japan, 1989–2019: Social Status, Social Consciousness, Attitudes and Values.

    "text": "Association for the Republic - Republican Party of Czechoslovakia\nThe Association for the Republic – Republican Party of Czechoslovakia (Sdružení pro republiku- Republikánská strana Československa SPR-RSČ), also called “Coalition for the Republic” or often just the “Republicans”, was a far-right nationalist party formed by Miroslav Sládek in 1989, formally registering as a party in 1990 (Hanley 2012, 68). It contested with negligible success in the election that year but increased its vote to 6% in 1992 and 8% in 1996. The party was never in government and collapsed due to infighting and splits after the 1998 election.\nSládek practices an “aggressive” populism (Mareš 2011, 285) that has been called “anti-establishment” (Kopeckỳ 1995, 148; Kopecky and Mudde 1999, 418; Dočekalová 2006, 12), “anti-system” (Vlachová 1997, 47; Balík and Hloušek 2016, 108; Hloušek 2010, 98) and stylistically “eccentric” (Brokl 1992, 122), with SPR-RSČ representatives becoming known for their “extremist excesses” (Smolík 2011, 103). The party espoused a radical opposition to the new post-communist political class, which it frequently accused of acting in corrupt self-interest (Hanley 2012, 72); in Sládek’s words, pretending to champion programmatic causes only to “continue their sweet inactivity at the expense of the majority of citizens” (cited in Hanley 2012, 74). Sládek once alleged that this political class had “committed high treason, for this they will hang... after our victory, the privileges of the parasites will be abolished and their property confiscated” (Ulč 1996, 93). The party viewed the material problems of the post-communist transition were therefore not a consequence of marketisation, but a deliberate plot by the elite to control the people (Hanley 2012, 76). A part of this argument was the allegation that the Velvet revolution was a sham, and that former communists and dissidents were in fact part of the same network (Hanley 2012, 69). The post-1989 muti-party system was therefore merely a façade (Hanley 2012, 75), as all other parties (referred to by the party as the “Gang of Five”, Dočekalová 2006, 12) were essentially the same. (Hanley 2012, 78). Against this political class Sládek contrasted the “ordinary people” who had been hitherto forced to “merely to watch passively as power is taken over” (cited in Hanley 2012, 74), claiming that only the SPR-RSČ could save the nation on their behalf (Dočekalová 2006, 11). This is clearly sufficient to code the party 3 on OTH_POLCLASS.\nThe SPR-RSČ has frequently been described as “racist” (Vlachová 1997, 50; Hanley 2012, 69), “nativist” (Stojarová 2018a, 36), and “xenophobic” (Stojarová 2018a, 36) in the literature. According to Smolik it placed “emphasis on the ethnic roots of social and criminal problems” (Smolík 2011, 103). This ethnocentrism was primarily due to its consistent hostility toward-Roma people (Dočekalová 2006, 12; Hanley 2012, 69; Mareš 2011, 285; Stroehlein 1999), whom it directly linked to crime (Císař and Štětka 2016, 290). Sládek once said, for example, “If we want to lower the crime rate and clean our cities, first we have to solve the Gypsy problem” (Dočekalová 2006, 12). According to Ulč this reached the point of calling for ethnic cleansing against the Roma population (Ulč 1996, 94). Sládek was also hostile to ethnic Germans and Vietnamese (Stojarová 2018a, 36), and was once charged with race-hatred offences for comments suggesting regret that more Germans had not been killed in World War II (Hanley 2012, 71; Stroehlein 1999) (OTH_ETHNIC = 3). This overlapped with Sládek’s anti-immigration rhetoric (Mareš 2011, 285; Ulč 1996, 94), including his “hostility to African and Vietnamese guest workers” (Hanley 2012, 69) and rhetorical linkages between immigrants and crime or other social problems (Smolík 2011, 103) (OTH_IMMIGRANTS = 3).\nRegarding economic elites, Hanley mentions that Sládek criticised “the dictatorship of money” (Hanley 2012, 73), and that the privatisation process had been used by the elite to enrich themselves 2012, 75), however this appears to relate more to the corrupt riches of the political class more than the rich or big business per se, and hence we’ve coded the party 1 on OTH_FINANCIAL. Numerous sources claim that foreign states and entities were key “others” in the party’s populism, specifically Germany (Dočekalová 2006, 12; Hanley 2012, 75) and later NATO (Kopecky and Mudde 1999, 418). In Hanley’s words the party “link[ed] domestic elites with external threats and foreign interests” (Hanley 2012, 75), however we’ve not seen evidence that the domestic elite was regarded as total controlled by these foreign forces, and hence we’ve coded it 2 on OTH_FOREIGN = 2. We’ve seen no evidence that the party was hostile to the military (OTH_MILITARY = 1).\nThe SPR-RSČ has been universally placed on the “far right” (Císař and Štětka 2016, 287), “radical right” (Hanley 2012, 68; Stroehlein 1999) or even the “fascist” end of the political spectrum (Vlachová 1997, 50), and indeed the party self-identified as an “extreme right-wing party” (Kreidl et al. 2000, 71). Although its economic program occasionally called for increased social benefits and services, this was balanced by calls for less state intervention (Hanley 2012, 70). On the whole however it did not focus very much on economic issues (Vlachová 1997, 50), and its agenda therein lacked, in Hanley’s words, “intellectual and programmatic sophistication” (Hanley 2012, 82). Owing to the salience of its radical cultural nationalism, we’ve therefore coded it FR on LRPOSITION.\nSládek has been considered in the literature a “charismatic” figure (Mareš 2011, 285) and “a skilled and provocative public speaker” (Císař and Štětka 2016, 290). In Hanley’s words “[t]he SPR-RSČ was quickly marked by Sládek’s egocentric, dominant personality and his radical outspoken statements” (Hanley 2012, 69). Internally Sládek had an “authoritarian style” (Mareš 2011, 286), and the party lacked formal structures that could hold it together in the absence of his dominant leadership beyond his inner circle of close friends and family (Hanley 2012, 72) (CHARISMA = 3).\nSPR-RSČ and Sládek had “authoritarian elements” from the beginning (Hanley 2012, 69), and have threatened the norms of liberal democracy in several ways. Sládek has incited violence (Stojarová 2018a, 41), maintained alliances with various skinhead groups (Ulč 1996, 94), and defended the use of violence against “illegitimate authorities” (Hanley 2012, 79). When he was charged with hate speech in 1997 he avoided courts, only to be tracked down by the police (Stroehlein 1999). Regarding the party’s acceptance of the democratic system, Vlachová claimed that the party did not accept the “game” of parliamentary democracy, as displayed by members’ politically motivated criminal acts (Vlachová 1997, 47). Hanley on the other had claims that the party was not ideologically opposed to liberal democracy (as compared to other Czech fascist and neo-Nazi groups, but by our standards it does appear to deserve 3 on LIBDEMNORMS. SPR-RSČ and Sládek never served in government (INSIDER = 1)."

    "text": "Public Affairs\nPublic Affairs, (Věci Veřejne, VV) also called “Public Action” was created in 2002 as a citizen’s initiative in Prague focusing on local issues including like services for families (Havlík and Hloušek 2014, 556; Just and Chárvat 2016, 93). In the lead up to the 2010 election it emerged as a populist contender with a protest vote narrative, claiming almost 11%. Its emergence from obscurity is largely due to both the investment of businessman Vít Bárta and the role of investigative journalist Radek John (Mareš 2011, 292), who became the party’s chairman and leader in 2009 and gave credibility to its anti-corruption message. VV was a coalition partner of the government after the 2010 elections (Mareš 2011, 292), but was riven by internal scandals and splits that saw it collapse in 2012 (Císař and Štětka 2016, 288), with both the original and breakaway entities receding into irrelevance soon after. The main reason for its collapse was the revelation that Bárta had developed the party mainly to aid his business interests (Havlík and Hloušek 2014, 553; Roberts 2019, 437), an attribute which has led VV to be labelled a “business-firm party” in the secondary literature (Just and Chárvat 2016).\nPublic Affairs, (Věci Veřejne, VV) also called “Public Action” was initially created in VV’s core message was an “anti-establishment” (Havlík and Hloušek 2014, 558; Kopeček 2016, 730; Havlík and Voda 2016, 124) and “anti-corruption” (Císař and Štětka 2016, 287) platform targeting all existing parties of the left and right (Haughton, Novotná, and Deegan-Krause 2011, 397; Kim 2020, 625), claiming at one point to be “against everyone” (Dostálová 2021, 293). The party styled itself, in Maškarinec and Bláha’s words, as “pest control squad in top-level politics” (Maškarinec and Bláha 2014, 708), representing ordinary people against the corrupt establishment (Havlík and Hloušek 2014, 557; Kaniok 2014, 10). The core refrain of the party against the political class was that it was full of “dinosaurs” left over from the post-communist era who did not represent the people (Císař and Štětka 2016, 288; Havlík and Hloušek 2014, 557). Gaging the ferocity of this attack is somewhat difficult: at times John suggested that VVs claim was “not a personal attack against dinosaurs. They carried out their work and should step down,” suggesting a somewhat mild populist hostility to the political elite. However at other times John and party leaders were a lot harsher, claiming that “Thieves (politicians) need darkness so no one sees what they steal…(politicians) play games with public funds” or that (in Bárta’s words) the established parties had “led to a democracy of robber barons” (cited in Havlík and Hloušek 2014, 557). The party also launched its 2010 campaign by symbolically firing a cannon at that Czech government headquarters (Naxera 2018, 35). Other secondary sources have emphasised the corruption accusation that VV levelled against the “dinosaurs” (see Kim 2020, 626; Kaniok 2014, 10). We’ve therefore coded the party’s OTH_POLCLASS rhetoric as 3.\nVV was not essentially a nativist party, and according to Mareš it “refuse[d] extremism and racism” (Mareš 2011, 292). However according to others it did have an anti-Roma and anti-minority theme in its welfare chauvinism, referring to them in somewhat veiled terms as “unadaptable minorities” (Kim 2020, 626; Maškarinec and Bláha 2014, 708). We’ve therefore coded it 2 on OTH_ETHNIC. Major studies of the party do not talk about its position non immigration. One exception is Kim (Kim 2020, 619), who claims that it was anti-immigrant also on welfare chauvinism terms. We’ve therefore coded it 2 on OTH_IMMIGRANTS but this could be corroborated. As a party that was set up in the interests of a business and managed like one (Havlík and Hloušek 2014, 560), unsurprisingly sources do not suggest that VV targeted major business or the wealthy (OTH_FINANCIAL = 1). Mareš claims that it was pro NATO and pro-EU (Mareš 2011, 292), and we’ve seen no evidence for any OTH_FOREIGN rhetoric (= 1), or OTH_MILITARY rhetoric (= 1).\nThe party has been considered largely eclectic and non-ideological in terms of its policy programme (Císař and Štětka 2016, 291; Havlík and Hloušek 2014, 557; Just and Chárvat 2016, 95), and it distanced itself from left-right labels by embracing a loyalty to common sense rather than ideology (Voda and Havlík 2021, 282). It has been considered “centrist” (Havlík and Hloušek 2014, 553) or cetnre-right (Havlík and Voda 2016, 125), and due to its strong welfare chauvinism (Kim 2020, 619), we’ve coded it right of centre (LRPOSITION = CR). Sources suggest that the VV’s 2010 campaign was highly personalised around John’s “charismatic” image (Císař and Štětka 2016, 294), and that his corruption-fighting image was “central” to its message (Haughton, Novotná, and Deegan-Krause 2011, 397). Structurally, VV was organised around its chief financier Bárta, who had total control behind the scenes (Kopeček 2016, 730; Kubát and Hartliński 2019, 111), and used this to determine candidate selection (Havlík and Hloušek 2014, 563; Just and Chárvat 2016, 94; Hloušek and Kopeček 2018, 6). For its public reliance on John’s leadership we’ve coded it 3 on CHARISMA, but there are some accounts that Bárta was also presented as a leader to the public (Havlík and Hloušek 2014, 566). Bárta had rival politicians and activists followed by private security (Havlík and Hloušek 2014, 563), and organised so-called “social-intervention patrols” of uniformed members supposedly acting as vigilantes aiding the police (Mareš 2011, 292). The latter were shut down after criticism, for this we’ve coded the party 2 on LIBDEMNORMS. The party leadership had not served in government at the time of the 2010 election campaign (INISIDER = 1)."

    "text": "ANO 2011\n“Action of Dissatisfied Citizens 2011” (Akce nespokojených občanů 2011, ‘ANO2011’ or just ‘ANO’– ano means “yes” in Czech) was founded by Billionaire Andrej Babiš in 2011. Babiš was the owner of the agro-conglomerate Agrofert and one of the country’s richest men. In some ways ANO picked up where VV left off (Naxera 2018, 39), and it has also been considered a “business-firm party” (Kopeček 2016). After failing in the 2012 senate elections, a major investment in political marketing paid dividends the following year where it won 18.65% of the vote and 47 seats and joining a coalition government with established parties (Havlík 2019, 373). It then won the 2017 elections with 29.6% of the vote and 74 seats, with Babiš initially leading a minority government and then governing in a coalition with the Social Democrats with the support of the Communist Party.\nBabiš’ rhetoric was “anti-elitist” (Císař and Štětka 2016, 287), “anti-establishment” (Havlík and Voda 2014, 9) (Dostálová 2021, 293) and “anti-party” (Cirhan and Kopeckỳ 2017, 117), forming what Havlík calls an “apolitical technocratic populist narrative” (Havlík 2019, 371). He called the political establishment of politicians, parties and other “forces” a “matrix” that was trying to silence him (Hanley and Vachudova 2018, 281). Established parties and politicians were not differentiated in this claim (Kim 2020, 626), but grouped together as a homogenous bloc of “traditional political parties” who only pretend to be different from one another (Havlík 2019, 376, 378). These forces are irredeemably corrupt in his eyes (Naxera 2018, 32; Just and Chárvat 2016, 96; Kuba, Hudec, and Stejskal 2022, 3), having “watched over the embezzlement of the country” and “privatized politics for themselves and their pals” (cited in Havlík 2019, 376; Maškarinec and Bláha 2014, 708). He has also called the political establishment the “Czech Palermo” (Kopeček 2016, 732). In 2017 election ANO broadened its perception of the political class to include “power groups” operating behind the scenes (Kim 2020, 628). This elite was morally contrasted to the hard working and industrious Czech people (Císař and Štětka 2016, 287–88), exemplified by Babiš and his business success (Havlík 2019, 376). For example, Babiš said in his first campaign that “We’re not like established politicians – we don’t steal, we work hard” (cited in Naxera 2018, 39). According to numerous scholars ANO did not moderate its populist rhetoric after joining government in 2013 (Havlík 2019, 373; Just and Chárvat 2016, 102; Hanley and Vachudova 2018, 281). We’ve therefore coded it 3 on OTH_POLCLASS in both 2013 and 2017.\nANO did not define the people or elite in ethnic or religious terms (Havlík 2019, 375), and “lacks a powerful narrative of Czech nationalism” (Hanley and Vachudova 2018, 278), in part because Babiš’ himself is Slovak-born (OTH_ETHNIC =1). It did however campaign to stop immigration in 2017, even though he rejected Okamura’s nativist anti-immigrant populism as fearmongering due to the fact that immigration into the country is extremely low (Kim 2020, 629). We’ve coded the party 1 on OTH_IMMIGRANT in 2013 and 2 in 2017, after the 2015 migrant crisis. The party revered business, and claimed that the solutions and practices of the business world could be effectively applied to the political system (Havlík 2019, 376; Maškarinec and Bláha 2014, 708). We’ve found no other evidence of OTH_FINANCIAL rhetoric (= 1).\nWhile the party avoided identifying on the left-right scale (Havlík and Voda 2014, 9) and maintained a degree of ideological vagueness (Brunnerová 2018, 33; Just and Chárvat 2016, 99), the party is generally described as “centrist” (Dostálová 2021, 288; Kuba, Hudec, and Stejskal 2022, 3), as confirmed by a study of votes by ANO deputies (Hájek 2017). It has been called economically “liberal” (Hanley and Vachudova 2018, 281) and “neo-liberal” (Kim 2020, 619), and Babis has occasionally identified as centre-right (Havlík and Voda 2014, 9). There may be a case to code it CR but for now we’ve coded it C on LRPOSITION.\nBabiš’ charisma has been central to the ANO project (Kubát and Hartliński 2019, 112; Kopeček 2016, 732), to the extent that he “represents the image of the whole party” (Brunnerová 2018, 33), and the party is seen as fundamentally connected to and dependent on him (Just and Chárvat 2016, 96; Kubát and Hartliński 2019, 108; 2019, 109). ANO has been called a “personal project” (Kopeček and Svačinová 2016, 135), and even Babiš himself has claimed the “The party is connected to my person. The party is me” (Hájek 2017, 280). Babiš had total control of the party organisatio, and provided lots of its funds (Hloušek and Kopeček 2019, 41; Just and Chárvat 2016, 97). At one meeting with deputies over the direction of the party, he simply asserted “I pay, I decide” (Hloušek and Kopeček 2019, 41).\nBabiš and ANO wanted a more centralised political system with less limitations on the executive, including strengthened state influence on public media (Havlík 2019, 380). He has also expressed a philosophical hostility to checks and balances (Hanley and Vachudova 2018, 282), which some have considered a rejection of pluralism and embrace of authoritarianism (Hanley and Vachudova 2018, 282). We see these however as systemic changes within the bounds of liberal democracy, and not necessarily a threat to liberal democracy per se, so we’ve coded the party 1 on LIBDEMNORMS, but this could be revisited. Babis was connected to the political establishment well before he founded ANO (Havlík 2019, 373; Roberts 2019, 434), but did not serve in any government prior to 2013. We’ve coded him 1 on INSIDER for that election and 2 for 2017 after ANO’s stint in coalition government."

    "text": "Dawn of Direct Democracy/ Freedom and Direct Democracy\nDawn of Direct Democracy (Úsvit přímé demokracie, often just called ‘Úsvit’) was created by businessman and senator Tomio Okamura before the 2013 elections on a platform of right wing “direct democracy” platform. Okamura had previously been a prolific commentator and author (Císař and Štětka 2016, 288). The group entered parliament after polling 6.8% but split in early 2015 due to an internal crisis when ten of the party’s 14 MPs opposed Omakura’s leadership (Cirhan and Kopeckỳ 2017, 119). After being ejected from Úsvit’, Okamura founded “Freedom and Direct Democracy” (Svoboda a přímá demokracie, SPD) in 2015 on basically the same themes as Úsvit (Kubát and Hartliński 2019, 110). In the 2017 elections SPD polled 10.6% of the vote, while Úsvit’ failed to return to Parliament. Given that both parties revolved around Okamura’s persona and rhetoric, we’ve not seen any reason to code them differently in the 2013 and 2017 elections.\nBoth Úsvit’ and SPD have been classed as “anti-establishment” (Kaniok and Havlik 2016, 28) and “anti-system” (Kuba, Hudec, and Stejskal 2022, 3) parties due to their hostility toward the political class and all-encompassing accusations of corruption (Havlík and Voda 2014, 9). Okamura disputed the existence of democracy in the Czech Republic, instead claiming that “it’s a government of the big mega-firms, the godfathers, and as their tools, they have the individual parties” (Voda and Havlík 2021, 282). He consistently claimed that the dynamics of the system were “rigged” (Kazharski 2022, 87) in favour of these “godfather party mafias” (Kim 2020, 627) on all sides of politics (OTH_POLCLASS = 3).\nWhat separated Okamura from other significant populist parties (VV and ANO in particular) was his use of ethno-centric and anti-minorities rhetoric (Kim 2020, 627) and xenophobia (Balík and Hloušek 2016, 105). Initially, this targeted the Roma (Havlík 2014, 46; Vít 2015, 85), whom he called “unadaptables” (Kim 2020, 627). Among several examples of this anti-Roma rhetoric: he has called for Roma to be sent “back” to India (Vít 2015, 99); denied the persecution of the Roma during the Holocaust (Naxera 2018, 49); and visited prisoners convicted of racially motivated murder (Bonansinga 2015, 113). More recently Okamura has targeted Muslims as an “other” to the Czech people (Krobová and Zàpotockỳ 2021, 59). He has proposed a complete ban on Islam in the name of “freedom” (Kim 2020, 619), suggested that his followers walk pigs and dogs near mosques (Bonansinga 2015, 113), and claimed that Czech women will be forced to wear headscarfs if more Muslims come (Vít 2015, 104). SPD MPs have also called Muslims an “invasive species” in Europe (Kazharski 2022, 86). We’ve therefore coded Úsvit’ and SPD 3 on OTH_ETHNIC.\nThis ethnocentrism overlapped with a sharp hostility toward immigrants (Kazharski 2022, 85; Císař and Štětka 2016, 295; Maškarinec and Bláha 2014, 709; Havlík 2014, 46), who were placed in contrast to the needs of the Czech people. This can be seen in election slogans like “Support to families, not to unadaptables. Work to our [people], not to immigrants” (Kim 2020, 627). While this increased significantly due to the 2015 immigration crisis, scholarship preceding this still points to the centrality of immigration in the party’s program (Havlík 2014, 46; Maškarinec and Bláha 2014, 709), which is somewhat ironic as Okamura himself is the son of a Japanese-Korean migrant father (Kazharski 2022, 85). We’ve therefore coded the parties 3 on OTH_IMMIGRANTS in both 2013 and 2017. Okamura has been described as “soft-Eurosceptic” (Kaniok and Havlik 2016, 28), but we’ve not seen evidence that it considers foreign forces or states to be the enemy of the people (OTH_FOREIGN = 1). Likewise, we’ve seen no evidence of OTH_FINANCIAL or OTH_MILITARY rhetoric (both = 1).\nThough Okamura has distanced the party from left-right labels (Voda and Havlík 2021, 282), and has been described as ideologically vacant by some (Vít 2015, 99), both parties are universally considered either far right (Dostálová 2021, 288; Kazharski 2022, 84) or extreme right (Naxera 2018, 46). While this is most apparent in its ethno-nationalism, it also espoused a “hyper-neoliberal welfare chauvinism” on economic matters (Kim 2020, 627) (LRPOSITION = FR). Both parties revolved around Okamura’s personality (Vít 2015, 99; Kopeček and Svačinová 2016, 150) as demonstrated by the fact that the Úsvit disintegrated when he left it (Kubát and Hartliński 2019, 110). This was more structurally so in SPD, which was governed totally by him as chairman (Kubát and Hartliński 2019, 112) in an authoritative style (Cirhan and Kopeckỳ 2017, 119) (CHARISMA = 3).\nOkamura has questioned the legitimacy of democratic institutions and the media. When he was barred from running for president in 2012 due to insufficient signatures, he claimed that the system was “rigged” to keep candidates like him out, and that “mafia godfathers were paying the media to be biased in favor of some of the candidates” (Kazharski 2022, 87). As discussed above he has also instructed his supporters to harass Muslims (Bonansinga 2015, 113). We’ve coded the parties 2 on LIBDEMNORMS, although there is a case for this to be increased to 3. Okamura has not been a senior figure in government before (INSIDER = 1)."

    "section": "Czech Pirate Party",
    "text": "Czech Pirate Party\nThe Czech Pirate Party (PP-CZ or “Piráti”) was founded in 2009 by programmer Jiří Kadeřávek on the mantra that “traditional political elites” could not be relied on to ensure internet freedom anymore after the Swedish Pirate Bay case (Šárovec 2019, 4). By the 2017 election it was led by Ivan Bartoš, and surprised many by polling 10.8% and entering parliament for the first time. With 22 seats in the legislature it became the most successful Pirate party to date.\nWhether Pirate Parties should be considered populist has been subject to much debate. Like other Pirate Parties, the Czech Pirates based their formal programme on internet freedom, data privacy, and opposition to tech monopolies (Šárovec 2019, 5) – a programmatically specific agenda that is not itself populist. However the literature suggests that the Czech Pirates extended from this base to a more all-encompassing and invective critique of the political class that focussed on corruption (Naxera 2021, 5; Lucarelli, Fuschillo, and Chytkova 2020, 1144; Maškarinec 2020, 523) and “vigorously criticis[ed] the established order” (Pink and Folvarčný 2021, 177). Numerous scholars have noted that this anti-establishment rhetoric became a “distinguishing feature” of the party (Dostálová 2021, 294), and according to the party’s own strategists, this “protest” narrative superseded its other programmatic focuses during the 2017 election (Šárovec 2019, 10). In one clear example of a populist campaign narrative, the party campaigned with a bus previously used by the prison services adorned with images of established politicians wearing prison uniforms and the motto “Let us blow them down!” (Naxera 2021, 5; Šárovec 2019, 11). As Šárovec describes it:\n\nThe main slogans of the campaign, often depicted on black-and-white visuals, were such slogans like “Not everybody steals!”, “Let us go after them!”. On the web page of the “Pirates electoral guidepost” under the program, there are the following introductory words of the PP-CZ chairman: “We are the only party unrelated to scandals, corruption, and bureaucracy…” (Šárovec 2019, 10).\n\nThis anti-elite and anti-corruption criticism was directed against the entire political establishment. In Naxera’s words “The [Pirate’s] anti-corruption appeal was not directed against the left-wing or the right-wing parties, but rather at the system of established parties as such.” (Naxera 2021, 5). This is sufficient to consider the pirates populist by our definition, and we’ve coded them 3 on OTH_POLCLASS. Apparently they tempered their rhetoric significantly after reaching parliament in 2017 (Naxera 2021, 11).\nWe’ve seen no evidence for any rhetoric on the OTH_ETHNIC, OTH_IMMIGRANTS, OTH_FOREIGN or OTH_MILITARY variables (all = 1). The only “other” relevant to the party’s anti-establishment populism is OTH_FINANCIAL. In its initial digital privacy and freedom narrative, copyright and tech monopolies were a key threat to the freedom of ordinary people (Šárovec 2019, 5), and the party developed a stance against tax avoidance by multinationals (Pink and Folvarčný 2021, 181). It’s debatable whether this quite reaches a 3 by our definition, so we’ve coded it 2.\nThe Pirates eschewed left-right labels (Šárovec 2019, 5), and their official socio-economic policy was vague and ambivalent (Pink and Folvarčný 2021, 182). It could however be considered new left or left-libertarian in a similar vein to other Pirate parties (Lucarelli, Fuschillo, and Chytkova 2020, 1141), and some have considered the party economically centrist (Bakke 2022, 6). We’ve coded them CL on LRPOSITION but this could be revisited. The party was very decentralised, and didn’t rely on its leader (Naxera 2021, 5), and was internally governed by well-defined statutes and procedures that are independent from the executive. (Šárovec 2019, 4). The party even made a point of avoiding becoming a “one-man party” (Lucarelli, Fuschillo, and Chytkova 2020, 1143) (CHARISMA = 1). The party was not hostile to the media like other Czech populists (Naxera 2021, 10), and we’ve seen no evidence that it threatened liberal democratic norms (LIBDEMNORMS = 1). No members of the party leadership had ever served in government at the time of the 2017 election (INSIDER = 1)."

    "text": "Not included\nThe Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (Komunistická strana Čech a Moravy KSČM) is the successor of the Communist party of Czechoslovakia. Unlike other communist successor parties in eastern and central Europe, KSČM never made any transition into a more moderate social democratic party and retains a Marxist Leninist identity (Císař and Kubát 2021, 7). It has been frequently mentioned in studies of populism in the Czech Republic, many of which have concluded that the party has “populist features” (Císař and Štětka 2016, 287), or have claimed that it espoused anti-elite (Kuba, Hudec, and Stejskal 2022, 3), anti-establishment (Kopecky and Mudde 1999, 418), or (especially) anti-system (Balík and Hloušek 2016, 108; Císař and Kubát 2021, 7) characteristics. However most of this seems to be mainly due to the party’s ideological opposition to the post transition liberal democratic system, rather than due to an entrenched populist narrative in its campaigns. Many studies that have addressed its potential categorisation as populist have identified only “partial traces of populism” (Pitrová 2007, 8), or “partly revolutionary rhetoric” (Kuba, Hudec, and Stejskal 2022, 4), and noted that it “does not fulfil all the defining features of populism” (Císař and Kubát 2021, 7). Frič and Gyárfášová, for example, note the KSČM’s “above average levels of populism” regarding anti-elite and ant-establishment rhetoric in the 2010s, but note that this is significantly less so than the SPD, ANO2011 and Pirates (Frič and Gyárfášová 2019, 231). Likewise, even its anti-system opposition to liberal democratic rule needs to be qualified, as Vlachová has concluded that the party “works within the system and behaves according to its rules” (Vlachová 1997, 47). Research into the party system via texts from the 1990s did not find sufficient evidence of populist rhetoric. Therefore we’ve not included KSČM in the dataset. This should however be revisited in the future.\nReferences\nBakke, Elisabeth. 2022. “New, but Not More Diverse?

    "text": "One Nation Party\nOne Nation Party (ONP), led and created by Queensland Senator Pauline Hanson, has been Australia’s most recognisable populist party in recent decades. Hanson was once a Liberal Party candidate in outer-suburban Brisbane in the 1996 election, before the party disendorsed her due to past comments about indigenous Australians (Mason 2010, 186). She went on to stand and win as an independent. As a Member of Parliament she provoked enormous media attention through controversial nativist and xenophobic rhetoric. She founded ONP after winning, which enjoyed some success in the next 1998 election (despite Hanson losing her own seat) before collapsing under the pressures of internal and legal fights that ended up sending her to prison (Rutherford 2001). Under the new name Pauline Hanson’s One Nation it made a surprising comeback in the 2016 elections, but did not pass the 5% threshold in the lower house (although it did better in the Senate, where Hanson won a seat).\nHanson became an immediate sensation when she declared in her maidan speech in Parliament that Australia was in danger of being “swamped by Asians” (Mughan and Paxton 2006, 344). This was indicative of a range of her other xenophobic attacks on Asians (Ahluwalia and McCarthy 1998, 83), whom she claimed were responsible for drugs and crime (Stokes 2000, 28). More generally she classed immigrants from the “Third World” as a threat to Australian culture due to their refusal to assimilate into it (Reynolds 2000, 28; Mughan and Paxton 2006, 344; Deutchman and Ellison 1999, 36). In doing so she appealed to anti-immigrant attitudes in the community that major parties were less willing (at the time) to stoke (Goot and Watson 2001). She also made numerous statements critical of Indigenous Australians (Melleuish 1997; Deutchman 2000, 51; DeAngelis 2003, 86), claiming that a “reverse racism” policy was unfairly advantaging them in them via more generous welfare policies at the expense of others (Johnson 1998). All of this established her solid OTH_ETHNIC and OTH_IMMIGRANT foundations (both = 3).\nFrom its inception, the party sought to label as out of touch the political elite in the major parties (Labor and the Liberal/National coalition), and dissatisfaction with the functioning of the political system has always been a core part of ONP appeal (Reynolds 2000, 165; DeAngelis 2003, 86).\nHanson made general claims against “politicians” in a catch all way (Deutchman and Ellison 1999, 37), and cultivated an image as an “anti-politician, untarnished by not being a member of the generally despised political establishment” (Pasquarelli 1997, 6). Hanson claimed policies targeting and excluding white non-Indigenous Austrailans were bound with the fundamental elitism of the political system writ large. She claiming that the establishment had lost touch with the mainstream opinion and experience on race and immigration (Jackman 1998, 170), was forcing multi-culturalism on ordinary Australians against their will (Stokes 2000, 27), and pushed a repressive “political correctness” agenda to silence ordinary people (Ahluwalia and McCarthy 1998). This system, she claimed, resulted in a net benefit for the elites – which she termed the “New Class” (Melleuish 1997, 25) – at the expense of ordinary people. In one notable example of this narrative, Hanson claimed that:\n\nIn response to my call for equality for all Australians, the most noisy criticism came from the fat cats, bureaucrats and the do-gooders. They screamed the loudest because they stand to lose the most – their power, money and position, all funded by ordinary Australian taxpayers (Jackman 1998, 168).\n\nIn opposition to this elite, Hanson sold her credentials as someone in touch with “the people”, owing to her humble outer suburban origins and her time running a fish and chip shop (Moffit 2017, 124; Deutchman 2000, 36; Nile 1997, 1). Due to this rhetoric we’ve coded ONP as 3 on OTH_POLCLASS.\nBanks and big businesses were among the New Class elite in her discourse (Stokes 2000, 30). Specifically, she accused Australian companies of selling out to foreign stockholders (Louw and Loo 1997, 6) at the expense of the national interest. Given that this was a relatively smaller “other” to the people, we’ve coded ONP as 2 on OTH_ECONOMIC. Despite being opposed to foreign immigrants, we’ve seen no evidence that Hanson accused foreign powers or entities of controlling Australian politics at the expense of the people (OTH_FOREIGN = 1).\nDespite generally maintaining a state interventionist and protectionist set of economic policies (DeAngelis 2003, 86), Hanson’s cultural and immigration policies are by far the more salient part of her politics, and for that she has been consistently labelled “radical right” in the secondary literature (Moffit 2017, 124; Deutchman and Ellison 1999, 34) (LRPOSITION = FR). ONP has always been a personalist operation (Moffit 2017, 125), totally dependent on Hanson's “charismatic” personality (DeAngelis 2003, 87; Mason 2010) and her capacity to attract media attention (Louw and Loo 1997; Deutchman and Ellison 1999, 35; Lewis 1997). Internally, Hanson and her close associates maintained total control of the party structure – one of the reasons why the party collapsed was its lack of internal democracy and Hanson’s autocratic leadership style (Rutherford 2001, 193). This has led ONP to be called the “One Person Party (Nile 1997) (CHARISMA = 3). Despite her attaches on social liberal norms, we’ve seen no evidence that Hanson or ONP threatened the liberal democratic system in Australia (LIBDEMNORMS = 1), and as she has never been part of any government, we’ve coded her 1 on INSIDER."

    "section": "Palmer’s United Party, Clive Palmer",
    "text": "Palmer’s United Party, Clive Palmer\nClive Palmer is a billionaire mining magnate who split from the Liberal-National Party (LNP) (of which he was once a financier) in 2012, allegedly after being denied a government contract to build a railway line. He stood in the 2013 election with his own party, Palmer's United Party (PUP) (Kefford and McDonnell 2018, 384). With an enormous advertising budget, PUP won 5.49% of the national lower house vote and one seat (taken by him) in the Parliament. Following the departure of several PUP senators after the election and Palmer’s extra-parliamentary business scandals, the project was put on hiatus in the subsequent 2016 election, only to return as the United Australia Party in 2019. In its comeback it only managed 3.43% of the lower house vote, due to which we have only included it in the dataset in 2013.\nThe central message of the PUP was its distain for the Australia’s two major parties (Moffit 2017, 125; Kefford and McDonnell 2016, 192). It claimed that these major parties (the Labor party and the LNP) were not only out of touch, but actively hostile to the interests of ordinary people. For example, Palmer accused LNP leader Tony Abbott of trying to “sell off Australia to people only concerned with making money. Whatever they pay, they will only do it so they can charge you more” (Kefford and McDonnell 2016, 185). PUP did not differentiate between the two parties, considering them part of the single corrupt system. In opposition to this system, he styled himself as an “anti-politician” (Watson 2014, 27), in touch with the concerns of ordinary Australians (OTH_POLCLASS = 3).\nAside from the political class, Palmer’s populism didn’t target very many “others” to the ordinary people. Although there is a nationalist steak to his politics, his OTH_FOREIGN rhetoric only picked up in his 2019 reincarnation (= 1 in 2013). Unlike Hanson, Palmer’s populism did not (during the 2013 campaign at least) target ethnic others or immigrants (Moffit 2017, 125; Watson 2014, 2)(OTH_IMMIGRANT = 1, OTH_ETHNIC = 1). In fact the party actually favoured increasing support to refugees and was generally more progressive on immigration than the major parties (Kefford and McDonnell 2016, 185; Moffit 2017, 133). As a major industrialist and billionaire, he never engaged in any consistent rhetoric against major financial interests or businesses (OTH_ECONOMIC = 1), nor against the military (OTHMILITARY =1).\nAs its name suggests, it has been seen as little more than a vehicle for Palmer's personal brand and ambition (Kefford and McDonnell 2016, 187). As a candidate he commanded a flamboyant, unpredictable personal image (Moffit 2017, 125; Watson 2014, 27), and a used a highly combative interview style. Structurally, the party was almost entirely funded by Palmer, and totally controlled by him (Kefford and McDonnell 2018, 385–89). For this reason PUP has been considered a “personal party” built around Palmer that would not exist without him (Kefford and McDonnell 2018, 388) (CHARISMA = 3). Palmer’s policies in the 2013 election were an “eclectic” (Moffit 2017, 125) mix of crowd-pleasing contradictions (Kefford and McDonnell 2016, 184), including higher spending, lower taxes and the elimination of the national debt, and as a result Kefford and McDonnell claim that the party’s ideology “cannot be easily classified” (Kefford and McDonnell 2016, 183). There may be an argument that the vague nationalism of the party makes it right-leaning, but we’ve coded it C on LRPOSITION due to its ideological ambiguity and vagueness. While Palmer was a high-profile donor to the LNP party before leaving it (Kefford and McDonnell 2018, 384), it is not evident that he was any kind of “insider” to previous governments in the way that we are using term (INSIDER = 1), and while he consistently attacked critics in the media with great vitriol (Moffit 2017, 125), there is nothing in his campaigning conduct that challenges liberal democratic norms as we’ve defined them (LIBDEMNORMS = 1).\nReferences\nAhluwalia, Pal, and Greg McCarthy. 1998. “‘Political Correctness’: Pauline Hanson and the Construction of Australian Identity.” Australian Journal of Public Administration 57 (3): 79–85.\nDeAngelis, Richard A. 2003. “A Rising Tide for Jean–Marie, Jörg, & Pauline?

    "text": "United Kingdom Independence Party\nThe United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) was created in 1993 by a group of academics, and only emerged politically in the European elections of 2004 and 2009 (Ross and Bhatia 2021, 189). Initially it was a “single-issue” party exclusively focused on opposition to the European Union (Usherwood 2008), but under the leadership of Nigel Farage from 2006 it began to champion other right-wing issues such as immigration and climate change denial (Bale 2018, 267). Traditionally the party did a lot better at European elections than general elections (Crines and Heppell 2017, 232), though this changed dramatically under the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government period (2010-15) when the party surged to 12.6% in the 2015 election. By threatening the seats of Conservative MPs in the Cameron government, UKIP is widely regarded to have triggered the 2016 referendum on EU membership (Evans and Mellon 2019, 76), the (successful) campaign for which was led by Farage. After this however the party’s fortunes declined dramatically, probably because its more “strategic” supporters considered its job done on the EU. Farage left the party to form the ’Brexit Party” in 2019, but this only scored 2.1% in the general elections of that year.\nBy the time of the 2015 election, UKIP was campaigning on a notably populist opposition to the political class and the major parties (Gifford 2014, 521), for which it has routinely been labelled “anti-elite” (Ross and Bhatia 2021, 191; Hughes 2019) and “anti-establishment” (Ford and Goodwin 2014, 282; Gifford 2014, 513; Crines and Heppell 2017, 233). Farage and UKIP claimed politicians – variously referred to as “our political class” (Crines and Heppell 2017, 241), “our ruling elite” (Tournier-Sol 2015, 149) or “establishment politicians” – consistently put their own interests above the people (Breeze 2019, 96; Ford and Goodwin 2014, 98), whom they had deliberately “betrayed” (Crines and Heppell 2017, 238), “failed” (cited in Ford and Goodwin 2014, 96), and “sold out” (Geddes 2014, 292). Farage consistently alleged that a “gulf” had opened up between this political class and the ordinary people (Tournier-Sol 2015, 149), and that the people’s grievances were due to the fact that this elite was “self-serving” (Crines and Heppell 2017, 243), and “always put their careers first’” (cited in Crines and Heppell 2017, 238). In doing so, Farage and UKIP did not discern any difference between the three major parties (Labour, Conservative and Liberal-Democrat), whom it lumped together as “the legacy parties,” (Breeze 2019, 96), and as a “LibLabCon-sensus” (Tournier-Sol 2015, 141). The wide spread public outrage at the expenses scandal several years earlier laid the groundwork for this catch-all opposition to the “political class” (Bale 2018, 268). This is all clear evidence for 3 on OTH_POLCLASS.\nUKIP’s main argument against this domestic elite was that it was in cahoots with a foreign elite, the EU, which it described in similarly populist terms as a ruling elite opposed to the interests of the ordinary people (Ross and Bhatia 2021, 203), and “hell-bent on causing as much trouble for the UK as it possibly can” (Breeze 2019, 97). According to Thorleifsson’s, in Farage’s speeches the “EU is framed as the external enemy, responsible for uncontrolled migration that in turn threaten jobs, exhausts public benefits and challenges the British and English way of life.” (Thorleifsson 2021, 192). It framed EU question as one of “invasion and oppression,” with posters titled “Ruled Britannia” (a play on the imperial slogan “Rule Britania) suggesting that the UK’s sovereignty had been essentially seized by Brussels (Ross and Bhatia 2021, 188), and that the domestic elite had a”surrendered” the people’s sovereignty this “an alien bureaucracy” (Tournier-Sol 2015, 142). According Tournier-Sol, “Farage presents European integration as resulting from a deliberate plot conceived by its founding fathers in opposition to ‘the people’” (Tournier-Sol 2015, 143). Given the conflation of the domestic elite with this foreign one, we’ve coded the party 3 on OTH_FOREIGN.\nUnder Farage’s leadership UKIP moved from a single issue party (focusing on Europe) to one that included other issues, especially immigration (Dennison and Goodwin 2015; Geddes 2014, 294). UKIP initially fused the issues of EU membership and immigration, particularly in relation to immigrants from Eastern Europe (Tournier-Sol 2015, 146). The party used the 2015 EU refugee crisis to suggest that the UK, were it to stay in the EU, would have no choice but to accept more asylum seekers than it could handle (Bale 2018, 270). However as the party grew its focus on opposing immigration grew beyond just a facet of its opposition to Europe (Gifford 2014, 522), claiming that immigrants both within and beyond the EU were a threat to the people for economic, ethno-cultural and security reasons (Thorleifsson 2021, 191). Economically, migrants from Eastern Europe were classed as a threat to British jobs (Bale 2018, 273), with posters depicting British construction workers begging on the side of the road because “British workers are hit hard by unlimited cheap labour” (Ross and Bhatia 2021, 203). Culturally, immigrants from non-western backgrounds were classed as an existential threat to the western way of life (Thorleifsson 2021, 188), with Farage lamenting that immigration had made parts of the UK seem “like a foreign land” (Bale 2018, 273). Immigrants were also considered a threat to public safety (Thorleifsson 2021, 193). This immigration crisis, according to the party’s communications, had been “engineered” by the previous labour government “with complete disregard for their traditional working class vote” (Breeze 2019, 97). (OTH_IMMIGRANTS = 3).\nAs is clear in the above, the party’s rhetoric regarding immigration had a clear ethno-nationalist dimension which was explicitly opposed to multi-culturalism (Breeze 2019, 94–99). For example, Farage claimed that “92 per cent of ATM crime is committed by Romanians” (Crines and Heppell 2017, 240), and that Muslims in the UK represented a “fifth column” (Saleem 2020, 465). In response to the Scottish Independence referendum, according to Ford and Goodwin, “Farage and his party have positioned themselves prominently as the voice of English nationalism” (Ford and Goodwin 2014, 277). However, UKIP was not as explicitly ethnocentric as other far right British parties (such as the British National Party) (Hughes 2019, 250), or other hard right populist parties in Europe (Thorleifsson 2021, 188). “UKIP,” according to Hughes, “are careful to avoid accusations of racism or xenophobia, and therefore their othering is sometimes quite subtle.” (Hughes 2019, 250). One of the reasons Farage gave for forming a new party for the 2019 vote was that UKIP had become “too extreme” in its ethnocentric nativism. (Thorleifsson 2021, 189). Due to this, we don’t think that UKIP in 2015 quite deserves a 3 on OTH_ETHNIC, and hence we’ve coded it 2.\nThe OTH_FINANCIAL variable is somewhat difficult for UKIP. Farage generally steered clear of traditional economic policy questions like unemployment benefits or wages, and implied his business acumen (financial background) was a key credential for governing (Crines and Heppell 2017, 238, 244). Yet, occasionally he and the party engaged in rhetoric demonising big business as a component of the elite, and UKIP voters generally shared the anti-business scepticism of labour voters (Ford and Goodwin 2014, 94). For example, Farage once said:\n\nI accept that open door immigration and mass cheap labour is good for rich people because it means cheaper nannies and cheaper chauffeurs and cheaper gardeners. And it is good for very big businesses and it is good for big landowners because it keeps their wage bills down (Ford and Goodwin 2014, 88).\n\nLikewise, some party material claimed that “Tories continue to [support open immigration] to suit big business.” (Breeze 2019, 97). However the fact that very few secondary sources mention this probably speaks to the issue’s relatively low salience compared to other “others” in the party’s rhetoric, and hence we’ve coded UKIP as 2 on OTH_FINANCIAL. Despite some occasional criticism of the military’s neglect of soldiers (Breeze 2019, 97), we’ve seen no evidence of substantial OTH_MILITARY rhetoric (= 1).\nWhile the party had some conventionally left-leaning policies (like support for public health and housing) the higher salience of its nativism and nationalism has led it to be universally considered “right wing” (Hughes 2019, 249; Gifford 2014, 513; Tournier-Sol 2015, 147) or “radical right” (Ford and Goodwin 2014, 277). There may be an argument for it to be placed at R on the LR_POSITION given its distance from other extremist right parties, but we’ve coded it FR. While Farage was in charge most sources emphasise that he and the party were essentially synonymous” (Hughes 2019, 250), and that UKIP was a “one-man band” (Tournier-Sol 2015, 153). Even during the brief period in which Farage stepped down as leader (2009-10), he was mentioned more in UKIP press releases than the party’s new leader (Hughes 2019, 257). The party’s fortunes surged when Farage was re-elected leader in 2010 (Crines and Heppell 2017, 232), and according to Evans and Mellon he personally boosted his party’s fortunes unlike any other party leader at the time (Evans and Mellon 2015, 10) (CHARISMA = 3). We’ve seen no evidence that UKIP was a threat to liberal democratic norms (LIBDEMNORMS = 1), nor that Farage was any kind of insider in previous governments (INSIDER = 1).\nReferences\nBale, Tim. 2018. “Who Leads and Who Follows?

    "text": "The Italian Social Movement (Movimento Social Italiano, MSI) was the successor party of the deposed government of Benito Mussolini. For decades after the Second World War it identified itself as a fascist party and was therefore relegated to political “ghetto” by the other parties who considered right wing politics of any kind toxic (Newell 2000, 469). After the 1992 Tangentopoli scandal exposed corruption within the political system and led to institutional changes to the Italian electoral system which gave more power to minor parties, the party gradually came “in from the cold” and changed its name to the National Alliance (Alleanza Nazionale, NA) in 1995. Under the leadership of Gianfranco Fini, the NA joined in a long-time “pole of freedom” coalition partnership with Forza Italia, and the two parties eventually merged to create the “People of Freedom” (Popoli della Libertà, PDL) party.\nThe party clearly changed as it re-entered the political system in the mid-1990s. However the precise dates of this change as they would reflect inclusion and coding in this dataset are difficult to determine. From around the time of the 1994 election (and name change) the leadership made clear statements in support of democratic institutions and disavowed many racist and anti-Semitic traditions of the far right. Thereafter many of the party’s fascist hard-core split off into the Fiamma Tricolore (Newell 2000, 480–82). Ignazi, while sceptical that this initial shift was often ambiguous and hollow, agrees that at least by the late 1990s the party leadership was “progressively and unambiguously leaving the territory of right-extremism” with statements of support for democratic institutions and critiques of fascism (although the party’s cadres and members did not always follow) (Ignazi 2004, 148–52). There is general agreement that by the end of the 1990s the party should not be considered “neo-populist” (Tarchi 2003, 174) or “anti-system” (Newell 2000, 484), and Ruzza and Fella actually regard the Fini’s participation in the post 2001 Berlusconi coalition government as a contrast to the other leaders (Berlusconi and Bossi) for his more moderate and constitutionally respectful leadership (Ruzza and Fella 2011, 159; see also Zaslove 2011, 63). In a way it seems that the party’s determination to detoxify itself saw it give up its far-right base right when the Lega Nord was ready to take it (Ignazi 2005, see). Tarchi notes that it was “one of the first preoccupations” of the NA leadership to reduce its anti-system character (Tarchi 2003, 139, 173; see also 2008, 90), even if early documents maintained the party’s opposition to the “partitocrazia” in Rome.\nGiven that this shift was evidently gradual, and may have occurred more in official discourse than other forms of discourse (see Tarchi 2003), it is certainly debatable whether and when the NA should be included. We’ve excluded it after its name change, but it may be the case that the NA’s early elections – especially 1994 – warrant inclusion for the continuation of anti-system populist rhetoric. This should be further researched.\nWhile some comparativists are hesitant to consider the Almirante-led post-fascist MSI as populist (Kitschelt and McGann 1997), in 1980s the MSI adopted an image of a “party of protest” (Zaslove 2011, 63; Ignazi 1993, 84), embracing its isolation as an “anti-system” movement against the corruption of the other parties (the partitocrazia) (Newell 2000, 473–74; Fella and Ruzza 2006, 180; Ruzza and Fella 2011, 168; Tarchi 2003, 157; Caciagli 1988, 29) (OTH_POLCLASS = 3). While staunchly anti-communist, the MSI also maintained some anti-capitalist themes consistent with fascist ideology (Furlong 1992, 352). However we’ve not seen evidence that this should register on the OTH_FINANCIAL variable (= 1).\nDespite being clearly extreme-right on the ideological spectrum (LRPOSITION = FR), in the 1980s and early 1990s the MSI did not seem to exhibit many of the ideological traits of the European populist right, many of which would be manifest in the Lega Nord. While exhibiting a clear sense of nationalism, the party did not focus on foreign “others” in its political discourse. Tarchi claims that despite a general anti-Americanism among the party’s base, the MSI was not particularly focused on foreign entities (Tarchi 2003, 165). It was also unopposed to European integration (Caciagli 1988, 28; Tarchi 2003, 165) or mildly sceptical (Kritzinger, Cavatorta, and Chari 2004, 958) of EU integration OTH_FOREIGN = 1. Its approach to ethnic others was also complicated. While the party had ideological to the ethnocentric narratives of fascism, it also included wings that emphasised Italy’s links with the Third World in cause of anti-capitalism (Furlong 1992, 352). It did include a strain of anti-Semitism under Almirante’s leadership (Parlato 2017, 53), and therefore deserves 2 on OTH_ETHNIC. According to Ignazi, in the 1980s when immigration first became a significant issue in Italian politics, MSI saw this as the consequence of capitalist domination of the Third World, and avoided demonising immigrants themselves (although Ignazi says that party cadres and members didn’t necessarily follow this view) (Ignazi 2004, 151; see also Zaslove 2011). Again, this was an issue-space that seemed to be taken by the Lega Nord in the 1980s.\nParlato states that the party was “strongly anchored to the charismatic role of Almirante” (Parlato 2017, 53; see also Caciagli 1988, 32), although given the party had a firm institutional base of its own (Ignazi and Ysmal 1992, 102) it should only be coded 2 on CHARISMA under his leadership. Once Fini took over in 1991, the party should not be considered leader-defined at all (= 1). MSI had “built into its genetic code” an opposition to the liberal democratic institutions that had seen the demise of the Fascist state (Newell 2000, 469; see also Tarchi 2003, 157), and had historical links to violent extremism going back to the post-war era (Caciagli 1988, 30; Furlong 1992, 348; Ignazi 1993, 83) (LIBDEMNORMS = 3). Although several party members had ties to the inter-war fascist regime, by the 1980s this could hardly be said to count towards any try INSIDER status (= 1)."

    "section": "Forza Italia",
    "text": "Forza Italia\nForza Italia (Let’s Go Italy, FI) is the party of Milanese Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. Berlusconi is a billionaire media magnate famous before his entry into politics for his ownership of multiple private TV stations and the AC Milan football club. FI’s entry into Italian politics occupied the space left by the collapsing Cristian Democrats in the early 1990s, and after a strong performance in its debut election in 1994 FI formed a short-lived government with the NA and LN. With these coalition allies (although intermittently with LN) Berlusconi was Prime Minister between 1994-95, 2001-2006, and 2008-2011, alternating mainly with centre left rivals. Forza Italia merged with the National Alliance (formerly the populist MSI) in 2009, creating the “People of Freedom” (Popoli della Libertà, PDL). As this party was still led by Berlusconi and the FI rank and file constituted the bulk of its members and voters (McDonnell, 2013), we have characterised the PDL as a continuation of FI rather than a new party.\nBerlusconi’s entrance into Italian politics came at a point when trust in established parties and politicians was at an all-time low due to the Tangentopoli corruption scandal. Due to this context, he built his political brand on a distinctly “anti-politics” (Ruzza and Fella 2011, 166; Tarchi 2008, 86; Pasquino 2007; Raniolo 2006, 437; Fella and Ruzza 2013, 39) populism that presented himself as a reluctant saviour of the people against the “old politics” of the other parties (Tarchi 2008, 86; Hopkin and Paolucci 1999, 325) and the “political elites” (Fella and Ruzza 2013, 40) (OTH_POLCLASS = 3). Although he occasionally attacked big business (Ignazi 2005, 335), Berlusconi and FI were thoroughly neoliberal and pro-entrepreneur (Ruzza and Fella 2011, 168), advocating lower taxes and constantly accusing the incompetent political class of meddling in the private sector’s affairs (Tarchi 2008, 96). A big part of Berlusconi’s own identity is of the self-made billionaire (OTH_FINANCIAL = 1).\nWhile a Eurosceptic attitude has always been present in FI (Raniolo 2006, 442), it is not clear that this or any other foreign foe reached the level of “other” to the “people” in the party’s populist rhetoric (OTH_FOREIGN = 1), which was one of the main differences between FI and its coalition partner LN. Another was its less ethnocentric approach to defining “the people” (Ruzza and Fella 2011, 166; Tarchi 2008, 85–86) (OTH_ETHNIC = 1). Berlusconi’s immigration politics is a little bit more difficult. While his government introduced controversial legislation restricting immigration (Geddes 2008), this was attributed more to FI’s coalition partners (LN and NA), and it is not clear in the literature that anti-immigrant discourse was an important party of the party’s campaigns (OTH_IMMIGRANTS = 1). This should be confirmed.\nWhile the coalition governments led by Berlusconi are considered “right” (an important term in Italy given its association with fascism since the war), he and FI are universally considered “centre-right” in the literature for their moderate conservatism (Sapelli 1997, 179; Tarchi 2008, 84; Ignazi 2004, 147; Zaslove 2011, 61; D’Alimonte 2019, 122; Verbeek and Zaslove 2015, 306) (LRPOSITION = CR). FI was, especially early on, dependent on the personality of Berlusconi (Hopkin and Paolucci 1999, 324; Raniolo 2006; Ignazi 2004, 147; 2005, 335; Ruzza and Fella 2011, 166; Tarchi 2008, 86; McDonnell 2013, 220), who presented himself as a savour of Italy unconnected with the establishment (Zaslove 2011, 61). McDonnell suggests that this has continued under the PDL (McDonnell 2013). While FI it was originally little more than an arm of Berlusconi’s business interests (Hopkin and Paolucci 1999, 321), several scholars claim that the party attempted to become more institutionalised and less leader-dependent in the late 1990s (Zaslove 2011, 61; Raniolo 2006, 441). This however this is not enough to reduce the CHARISMA coding of FI down from 3 for its duration.\nBerlusconi build a “politics of doing” to contrast the accused “politics of chatting” of the political class (Fella and Ruzza 2013, 40), which involved pushing back against state institutions that checked on executive power. From 1994, the judiciary in particular was constantly accused of being partisan, corrupt and inefficient (Ignazi 2005, 335; Tarchi 2008, 95; Verbeek and Zaslove 2016, 306). Berlusconi’s ownership of such a large section of the media (in addition to his hostility to critical media) also constituted a threat to media freedom vis-à-vis the government (Statham 1996, 91). This is enough to consider FI/PDL a mild threat to liberal democratic norms, even if not an outright threat to democracy (LIBDEMNORMS = 2). While Berlusconi was very well-connected to the previous governments, he had no actual politics experience, and therefore is coded as 1 on INSIDER in 1994, and 3 afterwards."

    "section": "Lega Nord / Lega",
    "text": "Lega Nord / Lega\nLega Nord (Northern League, LN) was founded in the 1991 out of a number of regional “lega's” in northern Italy advocating for more political autonomy from Rome. For most of its life it has been led and dominated by founder Umberto Bossi. The party drifted in and out of partnership with Forza Italia in the 1990s – initially standing together in the breakthrough 1994 election, then bitterly falling out with Berlusconi after a few months in office, before re-joining in 2001. It has for most of its life advocated for federalism (even secessionism) to protect the “Padania” northern region. In 2013 LN was taken over by Mateo Salvini, and its identity shifted away from its regionalist origins and toward a more national and non-secessionist profile – as evidenced by its dropping the “Nord” from its name to become simply the “Lega” before the 2018 elections.\nAlongside its demand for regional autonomy in the late 1980s, the original LN developed a populist opposition to the dominant political parties in Rome who formed a cordon sanitaire against several of the Lega’s early elections. Bossi railed against the incompetence and corruption of the “patrtitocrazia” in Rome (Gilbert 1993, 100; Albertazzi, Giovannini, and Seddone 2018, 648; Ignazi 2004, 153; 2005, 345; Fella and Ruzza 2006, 180; Ruzza and Fella 2011, 165), in part riding a wave of anti-establishment sentiment after the corruption scandals of the late 1980s (see Tarchi 2008). In Ignazi’s words: “the Lega offered itself to the northern ‘honest and laborious’ people as a sanctuary from the sleaze, corruption and selfishness of the traditional parties and politics” (Ignazi 2005, 345). Although Salvini shifted the geography of the “elite” from Rome to include Brussels (Vampa 2017, 34), this anti-political class rhetoric has continued under his leadership (OTH_POLCLASS = 3).\nThe Lega’s early platform of regional autonomy was rooted in both the ideology of devolution and a hostility to non-northern cultural/ethnic others: initially Southern Italian immigrants to the North and later immigrants from developing countries, in particular North Africa (Betz 1994, 122–23; Ignazi 2004, 153; Fella and Ruzza 2006, 180; Ruzza and Fella 2011, 165; Zaslove 2011, 57; Furlong 1992, 354). While Betz mentions that Bossi and the party attempted to moderate xenophobic rhetoric in the early 1990s, there was clearly enough explicit anti-Islamic and anti-African discourse in the party to warrant 3 on both OTH_IMMIGRANTS and OTH_ETHNIC in the 1990s under his leadership (Giordano 2004, 69; Woods 1992, 60; Ignazi 2004, 154; Tarchi 2008, 85; Fremeaux and Albertazzi 2002, 154; McDonnell 2006, 129). Under Salvini this has continued\nThere are a number of relevant points regarding OTH_FOREIGN. Under Bossi the Lega “ferociously criticised” the USA for its financial capitalism and pro-globalisation imperialism. However after 9/11 this subsided as Islam became a more important threat and the USA an ally (Ignazi 2004, 155; see also Verbeek and Zaslove 2015, 533). Interestingly the party was very pro-European as it considered the EU as advantageous to regional safeguards (Verbeek and Zaslove 2015, 531–32), before turning sharply Eurosceptic from 1998 (Kritzinger, Cavatorta, and Chari 2004, 958; McDonnell 2006, 128–29). It is difficult to pinpoint exactly when anti-EU rhetoric reached the point of a 3 on our coding scheme, but Giodano suggests the 2001 election as the best candidate (Giordano 2004, 73). For this reason the party’s OTH_FOREIGN coding elevates from 2 to 3 in that year. Under Salvini, hostility to the EU has grown to become an even stronger component of the Lega’s populist discourse (Vampa 2017; Brunazzo and Gilbert 2017, 625), which it now accused of being “totalitarian” (Albertazzi, Giovannini, and Seddone 2018).\nWhile the party under Bossi had a low-tax liberal economic outlook that valorised small businesses and small entrepreneurs (Bull and Gilbert 2001, 90; Zaslove 2011, 57), there are some scholars who claim that this included attacks on big business, banks and capital who stood in the way of the small northern producer (Tarchi 2008, 90–91; Biorcio 2003, 72–73; Bull and Gilbert 2001; McDonnell 2006, 128). This seems sufficient to code LN 2 on OTH_FINANCIAL under Bossi’s leadership, but as sources on Salvini’s leaderhip make no mention of this, we have dropped this down to 1 from 2013.\nIgnazi suggests that the early LN should be considered somewhat centrist (Ignazi 2004, 153–54; see also Verbeek and Zaslove 2016, 306). However the bulk of the literature identifies it as far right from its inception (LRPOSITION = FR). Bossi’s charismatic and “demagogic” leadership defined the party (Fella and Ruzza 2006, 180; Ruzza and Fella 2011, 159; Gilbert 1993, 100; Ignazi 2004, 153; Tarchi 2008, 90; McDonnell 2016), speaking with a “language that was clear, practical, evoking the everyday life of ordinary people” (Biorcio 2003, 84; see also McCarthy 1997, 343; Fremeaux and Albertazzi 2002, 150) and possessing an “uncanny ability to mobilise voters” (Zaslove 2011, 58). According to McDonnell, Bossi is held “held to possess extraordinary personal qualities and a fiuto politico (political sixth sense) which put his actions and U-turns beyond reproach” (McDonnell 2006, 130). The party's leader-dependence is equally true under the personal leadership of Salvini as it was under Bossi (Albertazzi, Giovannini, and Seddone 2018, 651), when charismatic leadership was necessary to overcome the contradictions of the party’s expansion into the south. However the party has become more institutionalised over time (McDonnell and Vampa 2016), and after Bossi stepped down in 2008 it seems more worthy of being coded 2 on CHARISMA (3 before this).\nAccording to Ignazi (Ignazi 2004, 154–55), the Lega has a history of violent party propaganda, the denegration of rules and institutions the hinder the people’s will, and even a paramilitary of sorts in the Camicie Verdi (“green shirts”) who staged mass ritual events and “Padana Patrols” (Biorcio 2003, 90). Lega members and leaders have occasionally used violent rhetoric to discuss its political rivals and immigrants, but there is not quite enough evidence of this to elevate it above a 2 on LIBDEMNORMS by the standards of other parties so coded. As the party participated briefly in the post 1994 Berlusconi government, it is coded 2 on INSIDER since that election. However as Salvini had no part in that government, we’ve taken it back down to 1 after he took control of the party."

    "text": "Five Star Movement\nThe Five Star Movement, (Movimento 5 Stella, M5S or FSM) is the creation of comedian Beppe Grillo. Grillo had commentated on politics since the 1970s, and was noted for his sharp attack on ruling politicians (Cremonesi 2017, 253). He became something of an underground figure after being kicked off public television in the 1980s for being too critical of Socialist Prime Minister Bettino Craxi, and in 2005 he formed a highly successful political blog (Bortoluzzi and Semino 2016). His informal following grew into a movement via both performances and online organisation. Starting around 2007 Grillo – by all accounts an “explosive speaker” (Ruggiero 2012, 317) – held a series of “V-Day” rallies (unofficially vaffanculo, “fuck off”) that attracted large audiences in town squares (Tronconi 2018, 164). Simultaneously, his blog readership was transformed into a sophisticated platform for polling members on policy stances via the new “Rousseau” software and linking members with each other via the “Meetup” website. FSM started to run candidates in 2010, and broke out in the 2013 general elections to become the most voted party with 25.5%. After years of resolutely ruling out any form of coalition with other parties, its increased success in the 2018 election (32%) led to a “populist coalition” with the far-right Lega, and after the collapse of that coalition in 2019, with the Democratic Party.\nM5S’s most important “other” is the political class, namely the established parties, which it described as one of two “castes” ruling the country unaccountably (the other being the media) (Bordignon and Ceccarini 2015, 455; Mosca 2014, 42). As an “anti-political” (Fella and Ruzza 2013, 39; Maggini 2013, 2), “anti-establishment” (Mosca 2014, 44) and “anti-system” (Fabbrini and Lazar 2013, 110) movement, it considered all the parties to be essentially the same (Bortoluzzi and Semino 2016, 2), and ran on slogans like “all politicians have to go home” and “all professional politicians are corrupt” (Hartleb 2013, 139). Considering itself a “free association of citizens” rather than a political party (Lanzone 2014, 68; Cosenza 2014, 90), Grillo considered political parties and representative democracy itself were dead as instruments for serving citizens’ interests, and that MPs should merely be passive servants of the people’s demands (Diamanti 2014, 4). In his words, “We want 100% of Parliament, not 20% or 25% or 30%. When the movement gets to 100%, when the citizens become the state, the movement will no longer need to exist” (Manucci and Amsler 2018, 18). Eschewing any form of ideological pedigree, he therefore chose politicians on the basis of their ordinariness rather than any kind of political experience or leadership (Bordignon and Ceccarini 2015, 458). In campaigns, Grillo also used his considerable rhetorical skill to personally demean leaders of other parties (Bortoluzzi and Semino 2016; Franzosi, Marone, and Salvati 2015, 110), including their private lives (Hartleb 2013, 139), and maintained this high level of antagonism after forming government (Corso 2019, 463). All of this clearly warrants 3 for OTH_POLCLASS.\nAside from this very consistent opposition to the political class, the ideological and programmatic profile of the M5S is extremely difficult to pinpoint. A number of analyses suggest that the movement is somewhat left wing (Hartleb 2013, 139; Mudde 2016, 15) or “left libertarian” (Verbeek and Zaslove 2016, 307), which may be due to Grillo’s initial focus on environmentalism and sustainability, the movement’s linkages with the anti-globalisation discourses of the early 2000s, and the fact that many of its initial members were members of left wing associations (Manucci and Amsler 2018, 7). However the majority of scholars consider the movement more difficult to categorise, describing its ideology as “catch all” (Mosca 2014, 46), “post-ideological” (Maggini 2013, 7; Manucci and Amsler 2018), “eclectic” (Mosca and Tronconi 2019), out of the left-right dimension” (Chiaramonte et al. 2018, 482). Grillo himself has described the movement as “beyond” the categories of left and right (Bordignon and Ceccarini 2015, 460; Bortoluzzi and Semino 2016, 3). This difficulty is in part due to Grillo’s focus on somewhat technical and “post-material” issues like transport, water, and internet access (Cremonesi 2017, 254; Corso 2019, 469), but also due to the seemingly contradictory nature of its policy stances on traditionally contentious matters. On economic matters for example, Grillo and the party have advocated some left-leaning policies in favour of state intervention and a universal income and opposition to austerity, but simultaneously taken an anti-tax line that comes close to defending tax evasion (Mosca and Tronconi 2019, 1276; Bordignon and Ceccarini 2015, 460). The party shows similar ambivalence to immigration and Europe (see below). Manucci and Amsler, who have focused directly on the movements’ ideological profile, define it as a “‘purely populist’ party because it has no thick ideologies attached to its thin ideological core” (Manucci and Amsler 2018, 3). With this in mind, the party is categorised as C on LRPOSITION.\nThis ideological and policy ambiguity makes its opposition to “others” aside from politicians equally difficult to determine. Occasionally Grillo’s rhetoric has targeted “global financial powers” (Miconi 2015, 1044) and the national telecommunications company Telecom (Manucci and Amsler 2018, 7) and “some expressions of economic oligarchy” (Lanzone 2014, 62), but on the whole these groups only seem relevant when they relate to the Italian political class’s corruption, and it does not appear that the movement’s discourse should register on the OTH_FINANCIAL scale (= 1).\nLikewise, the party’s position on OTH_IMMIGRANTS is difficult. Early on the party completely avoided the sensitive subject (Mosca 2014, 47; Turner 2013, 206; Mosca and Tronconi 2019, 1277)(Mosca, 2014:47; Turner, 2013:206; Mosca & Tronconi, 2019:1277), but according to D’Alimonte when Salvini started to voice strong anti-immigrant sentiment in the 2018 election Grillo “followed suit” (D’Alimonte 2019, 117). Other scholars have noted that the Grillo and the party have occasionally veered toward anti-immigrant policies (Bordignon and Ceccarini 2015, 460). However this does not necessarily mean that immigrants are an “other” to the party’s version of the people, something that is captured best by Bulli and Soare:\n\nthe M5S’s stances on immigration are essentially filtered by their emphasis on the people’s will. There is no a priori exclusion either in terms of welfare chauvinism or in terms of a cultural or religious threat. It is mainly the denunciation of the way immigration is managed by the corrupt national elites and/or the technocratic elites in Brussels that characterises the M5S discourse (Bulli and Soare 2018, 149).\n\nThis makes it difficult to categorise the party as anything other than a 1 on OTH_IMMIGRANTS. OTH_ETHNIC is easier to code (=1), given that all scholars agree that ethnic identity and xenophobia does not play a part in the Movement’s discourse (Corso 2019, 464; Lanzone 2014, 63; Mosca and Tronconi 2019, 1277). There is also no evidence to suggest OTH_MILITARY populism (= 1)\nThe party’s attitude to Europe is also very murky, and has been the subject of much debate in the literature (Cremonesi 2017, 257). Like on other matters, Grillo initially avoided taking a stance on Europe (Mosca 2014, 47), and has always tried to have it both ways (Franzosi, Marone, and Salvati 2015, 113). Similar to immigration, Grillo’s criticism of Brussels often seems to be filtered through his opposition to the Italian political class; for example by criticising Europe for funding Italian politicians and excusing their corruption (Corbetta and Vignati 2014, 56–57). Grillo has called for a referendum on the Euro, and his speeches suggest he is opposed to the currency (Corbetta and Vignati 2014, 58). While this is not OTH_FOREIGN populism per se, several scholars point out that since the 2014 European elections, Grillo and the party have taken a harsher line against European elites. Franzosi, Marone and Salvati claim that the party represented Prime Minister Mateo Renzi as “an agent of German interests in Italy”, and that members sometimes lashed out at the “brussels caste” in a similar way as they did against the Italian establishment (Franzosi, Marone, and Salvati 2015, 116). While this a difficult call, we’ve decided to code 2 for OTH-FOREIGN in 2018 (1 for 2013).\nAll analysis suggests that Grillo is central to the movement’s meaning and identity (Bentivegna 2014; Lanzone 2014; Mosca 2014, 43), and FSM has been called a “personal party” (Bordignon and Ceccarini 2015, 465) and a “one man show” (Hartleb 2013, 140). Grillo has often been accused of authoritarian management of the movement (Hartleb 2013, 139), and some members have been thrown out for voicing these concerns (Bordignon and Ceccarini 2015, 458; Bortoluzzi and Semino 2016, 3). He personally appoints all of the party’s representatives (Miconi 2015), and the Movement’s formal documents certify that he is the sole “guarantor” of the party’s brand (Cosenza 2014, 90). While some question the degree to which it can be called a personal party due to its usage of participatory polling to make policy decisions (Diamanti 2014, 4; Tronconi 2018, 176), in practice these grass roots instruments seem to be “relegated to a marginal role and employed only when compatible with the directions from above” (Manucci and Amsler 2018, 5). Hence the coding of 3 for CHARISMA seems to be clear.\nHaving never held any national political office, Grillo and M5S are clearly not INSIDERs (=1). Grillo’s vitriolic attacks on the media (Cosenza 2014, 90; Bordignon and Ceccarini 2015, 463), which he has called the other “casta” alongside politicians (Cremonesi 2017, 256), don’t quite rise to the point of threatening liberal democratic norms, and the party does not show any contempt for the rule of law or the judiciary (Corso 2019, 463) (LIBDEMNORMS =1).\nReferences\nAlbertazzi, Daniele, Arianna Giovannini, and Antonella Seddone. 2018. ‘“No Regionalism Please, We Are Leghisti !” The Transformation of the Italian Lega Nord under the Leadership of Matteo Salvini’.

    "text": "Reform Party/ Canadian Reform Conservative Alliance\nPreston Manning, son of Alberta’s longest serving premier Earnest Manning, founded the Reform Party in 1987. The party was built on a number of regionalist and populist traditions of previous Western political parties – especially Social Credit, to which Earnest Manning belonged (Budd 2021, 160). The party initially succeeded in mobilising opposition to the Charlottetown Accord constitutional referendum (Laycock 2005, 179), which attempted to give greater rights to minorities, especially Quebec. The referendum was defeated, and disillusioned supporters of the centre-right Progressive Conservative Party (CPC) (which supported the constitutional reform) flooded to Reform, which was the only major party in Anglophone Canada to oppose it (Laycock 2005, 179). Reform’s 19% in that election made it one of the largest parties in the Parliament. It maintained its vote share in the 1997 election before merging with the CPC to form the Reform-Conservative Alliance in 2000.\nReform campaigned on a narrative that the Canadian state had been infiltrated and co-opted by a collection of “special interests” (Patten 1999, 29), comprising of self-serving bureaucrats, unaccountable “old-line' parties (Barney and Laycock 1999, 323), and representatives of minorities, all of which were opposed to”ordinary Canadians” (Laycock 2019, 171). In doing so, Reform capitalised on widespread distrust of established political parties (Sigurdson 1994, 651) to create a brand that was an “anti-elite” (Budd 2021, 160), “anti-politics” (Barney and Laycock 1999, 332), “anti-partyis[t]” (Laycock 2019, 173) “regional protest party” (Snow and Moffitt 2012, 280). Manning himself emerged as a kind of “anti-politician”, willing to say the things that mainstream politicians wouldn’t touch (Sigurdson 1994, 265). Reform considered the elite of major parties to be the source of the people’s grievances (Mayer, Kaymak, and Justice 2000, 78), by steering state benefits towards the “special interests” at the expense of ordinary people (Budd 2021, 161). Its campaign slogans claimed that “In Ottawa, every special interest group counts except one: Canadians”, and “So you don’t trust politicians? Neither do we.” (Laycock 2019, 171). In Laycock’s words:\n\nTheir populism turned on depicting special interest/elites as actors, organizations and groups who promoted or benefited from state intervention in the market distribution of social and economic goods, all at the people’s expense. (Laycock 2019, 172)\n\nIn opposition to this, Manning’s stressed that his party was essentially beyond ideology, and instead embodied the “common sense of the people” (Budd 2021, 160; Kwak 2020, 1176). While there may be a case that Manning’s and Reform’s rhetoric against established politicians was less hostile than other populist parties, on the available evidence we’ve coded it 3 on OTH_POLCLASS.\nWhile the party styled itself as race-blind, its vision of the “people” and their “others” were clearly racialized (Kwak 2020), and the party has been defined as “antipluralistic” (Sigurdson 1994, 267) and opposed to multiculturalism (Erickson 1995, 136). It defines its community as the “broad Anglo-Canadian nation” (Mayer, Kaymak, and Justice 2000, 89), the enemies of which in the “special interests” were representatives of various ethnic out-groups (Sigurdson 1994, 261). In Pattens’ words, this identity was “a reaction to the perceived increase in the prominence and power of francophones, Québécois nationalists, ethnocultural minorities and Aboriginal peoples” (Patten 1999, 30). Manning’s stated that special interests activities created a “tyranny of modern ‘Family Compacts’ of bureaucrats, politicians and special interests that exercise the tyranny of a minority over democratic majorities” (cited in Barney and Laycock 1999, 325). The rise of Quebeqois identity was particularly significant to the party’s vision of the “people” their “others” (Patten 1999, 29; Sigurdson 1994, 265). While this is clearly evidence of ethnocentric rhetoric, a number of sources stress that the party was not as explicitly ethnocentric as other nativist populist parties (Mayer, Kaymak, and Justice 2000, 84; Budd 2021, 163), so we have coded it 2 on OTH_EHTNIC. Relatedly, the party considered immigration in similarly racialized and populist terms, claiming that “Canada's multiculturalism and immigration policies have been designed in response to the demands of an elite of powerful special interests” (Patten 1999, 35). Its 1988 policy platform stated that immigration “should [not] be explicitly designed to radically or suddenly alter the ethnic makeup of Canada, as it in­creasingly seems to be” (cited in Budd 2021, 163), and it called for a crackdown on “false refugees” alleged to be abusing the system (Kwak 2020, 1177; 2020). As with its ethnocentrism, numerous sources claim that Reform was “not crudely anti-immigrant” (Mayer, Kaymak, and Justice 2000, 84), and that Manning tried to distance himself from its most xenophobic factions (Budd 2021, 163), such that we’ve coded it 2 on OTH_IMMIGRANT.\nThe party is somewhat difficult to code on the OTH_FINANCIAL variable. Some sources emphasise that it maintained the anti-business attitudes of earlier Western populist parties (Mayer, Kaymak, and Justice 2000), campaigning against “plutocratic conspirators of eastern banking interests” (Mayer, Kaymak, and Justice 2000, 80), and a “coalition of government and business elites” (Budd 2019, 140; Gordon 2021, 44). However others claim that banks are not the party’s chief antagonist (Sigurdson 1994, 167) and that it even considered big business allies of “the people” due in part to the fact that major business groups sponsored it and its clearly neo-liberal and anti-welfare ideology (Laycock 2005, 187; Kwak 2020, 1175). Most sources on Reform don’t mention business or financial elites at all. Due to this mixed evidence, we’ve coded it 2 on OTH_FINANCIAL. We’ve seen no evidence to of rhetoric on the OTH_FOREIGN or OTH_MILITARY variables (both = 1).\nReform is also somewhat difficult to code on the CHARISMA scale. Manning is considered by some a “dynamic populist leader” (Erl 2021, 113), and personally defined the party’s branding to the electorate (Sigurdson 1994, 276). Yet, Reform also built heavily on prior traditions of Western populism, and Manning has been called a somewhat dull and non-inspiring figure compared to other more conventionally charismatic populist leaders (Moffitt 2016, 62). We’ve coded Reform 2 on CHARISMA in 1993 and 1997. Ideologically, while the party claimed to transcend the left-tight spectrum, its policies fit rather neatly in the neo-liberal wave of its time, advocating lower taxes, reductions in welfare and deregulation of the private sector (Laycock 2005, 180; Kwak 2020, 1175), and as a result of this and the higher salience of its non-economic cultural conservatism it is universally considered right wing (Sigurdson 1994, 265; Budd 2021, 160) (LRPOSITION = R). We’ve seen no evidence that Reform threated any liberal democratic norms (Knopff 1998, 702) (LIBDEMNORMS = 1.\nFor the 2000 election, Manning and Reform attempted to merge with the fledgling Progressive Conservative Party to prevent the vote-splitting on the right (which Manning believed kept the Liberal government in power). This saw the party change its name to the Canadian Reform Conservative Alliance (a.k.a. “The Alliance”), which kept most of the reform personnel and structures but encouraged participation by prominent PRP members. While Manning attempted to lead this party, he was defeated by one such PRP member Stockwell Day in an election of party members. This party went on to become the Conservative Party of Canada in 2003 after an official merger between it and the PCP. Thus it is difficult to say whether the Alliance’s 2000 election should be included in the dataset. We have decided to include the party with the same coding decisions as Reform but for CHARISMA (= 1 in 2000), given that Manning was no longer leader. This is backed up by Cross and Young (Cross and Young 2002) survey findings that suggest continuity between the core ideas and meaning of Reform and the Alliance."

    "text": "Bloc Quebecois\nThe Bloc Quebecois (BQ) started as a parliamentary caucus of major party MPs sympathetic to Quebecois identity and interest. It became a fully fledged political party under the leadership of Lucien Bouchard in YEAR, after the failure of the Meech Lake accord in 1991. As with Reform, BQ enjoyed break-out success in the 1993 on the failure of the Meech Lake accords (Erickson 1995, 135), in which it won 13.5% of the national vote and became the official opposition in Parliament after the collapse of the Progressive Conservative Party (PCP). It steadily lost support in subsequent elections, dropping to 4.7% in 2015, before rising to 7.6% in 2019. BQ is a difficult inclusion in the dataset. Separatist nationalism is not by definition populism, even if all such parties campaign in strong opposition to the existing political centre. We include BQ here because available evidence suggests that its rhetoric conformed to a general people/elite framework in which the (Quebecois) people’s interests were deliberately ignored by that elite.\nThe OTH_POLCLASS variable is tricky with BQ. While the party clearly showed distain for the mainly Anglophone establishment in Ottawa, it is not clear that this reaches the level of out-right hostility to the political class, and hence the party has been coded 2 on this variable. The only other “other” dimension relevant to the dataset is OTH_ETHNIC. BQ draws on a long history of perceived cultural marginalisation, promoting a separatist cause based on the idea that Anglophone Canada is an “other” to the Francophone “people”, and that various national governments in Ottowa have been estranged from Quebacois interests (Mayer et al, 2000: 80). There is some debate about whether the term “Quebecois” is an ethnic (French Canadian) moniker or geographic demonym (people from the province of Quebec, some of whom are not French Canadian). Some Canadians use the term Quebecker/ Quebecer to denote the latter (Mayer, Kaymak, and Justice 2000, 86) and consider the former an explicitly ethnocentric term, something disputed by leaders of QB. We’ve labelled the party 2 on OTH_ETHNIC given that the Francophone-Anglophone political narrative is clearly the essence of its populist character, yet not to the extent that ethnic others are defined as enemies in extreme terms. We’ve seen no evidence for anything above 1 on OTH_IMMIGRANT, OTH_FINANCIAL, OTH_MILITARY, or OTH_FOREIGN.\nPositioning the party on a LRPOSITION scale is very difficult, given that it is culturally conservative in its advocacy of sovereignty but includes heterogenous views on economic policies (Cross and Young 2002, 862; Mayer, Kaymak, and Justice 2000, 87). Due to the salience of cultural identity in the party narrative, we’ve labelled it CR, but this could be revisited. We’ve seen no evidence that the BQ’s leaders define its appeal (CHARISMA = 1), or that it threatened liberal democratic norms (LIBDEMNORMS = 1). As Lucien Bouchard was a former cabinet minister, we’ve coded 2 on INSIDER.\nReferences\nBarney, Darin David, and David Laycock. 1999. “Right-Populists and Plebiscitary Politics in Canada.” Party Politics 5 (3): 317–39. https://doi.org/10.1177/1354068899005003004.\nBudd, Brian. 2019. “The Populist Radical Right Goes Canadian: An Analysis of Kellie Leitch’s Failed 2016–2017 Conservative Party of Canada Leadership Campaign.” In Populism and World Politics: Exploring Inter- and Transnational Dimensions, edited by Frank A.

    "text": "Patriotic Front\nThe Patriotic Front (PF) was created by veteran politician Michael Sata in 2001 after he fell out with the governing Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD) party over presidential succession. Popularly known as “King Cobra” for his venomous attacks on rival politicians (Resnick 2013, 62), Sata succeeded in rallying voters in urban and Bemba-speaking regions who were frustrated with the effects of the MMD’s economic liberalisation (Larmer and Fraser 2007, 612). Sata and the PF stood in presidential and legislative elections in 2001 without success, but broke out in 2006 with 29.4% and 22.9% in the presidential and legislative elections respectively, placing second in both. Sata narrowly lost the election to succeed the Levy Mwanawasa in 2008 after the latter died in office, but then won in 2011 and assumed the presidency. Sata himself died in office in 2014, and the party chose Edgar Lungu to succeed him. Lungu won re-election in 2015.\nSata and the PF are frequently considered populist in the Zambia literature. While a lot of this relates to policy stances, there is enough analysis to suggest that Sata’s early elections (2001 and 2006) practiced a version of populism that is compatible with our minimum definition. This revolved around linking the economic grievances of his target audience with the corruption of the government (Paget 2014; Larmer and Fraser 2007, 613). In Sichuwa’s words, he “presented his political competitors, represented by the incumbents Mwanawasa and subsequently Banda, as colluding with mining companies to exploit ordinary workers” (Sishuwa 2021, 1064) (OTH_POLCLASS). Sata also employed a “highly emotional” (Hamusokwe and Mambwe 2021, 5) and “confrontational” style (Cheeseman and Hinfelaar 2010, 64), that deployed “sheer rudeness” towards people in power to construct a radical and subversive counternarrative (Larmer and Fraser 2007, 613).\nWhile this qualifies Sata and the PF for inclusion in 2006, subsequent elections are more difficult. After Mwanawasa died in 2008, Sata appeared to soften his rhetoric to the extent of selling himself as “a member of the political establishment well-placed to offer continuity and stability” (Cheeseman and Hinfelaar 2010, 67). His own deteriorating health also reduced his ability to play the antagonistic “strongman” figure of his earlier campaigns, and by 2011 “any idea that Sata represented a radical threat depended on memories of his performance in 2006 rather than any repeat of it” (Fraser 2017, 464–65). The literature also suggests that Lungu failed to emulate Sata’s populist narrative and performance (Hamusokwe and Mambwe 2021, 7; Fraser 2017, 457), and that by the time he took over the PF’s populism had been “watered down over time” (Hern 2020, 73). For these reasons we have not included Sata, Lungu, or the PF in the dataset after the 2006 election.\nDespite his role in the privatisation processes within the MMD, Sata’s narrative in 2006 championed the cause of poor workers (Larmer 2005, 42), the enemy of whom were, in Larmer and Fraser’s words, a “corrupt alliance between domestic political and business networks and a set of international sponsors” (Larmer and Fraser 2007, 613). His hostility towards foreign-owned mines and businesses has been considered xenophobic and nationalistic by many scholars (see Simutanyi 2010, 11; Larmer and Fraser 2007, 628; Cheeseman and Hinfelaar 2010, 67; Hess and Aidoo 2014). He was particularly harsh against Chinese investors, whom he called “infestors” (Hamusokwe and Mambwe 2021, 4) and agents of “Chinese colonialism” (Uzar 2017, 297). Notably, this hostility related to smaller scale Chinese and Indian shop owners in Lusaka (Resnick 2013, 79), claiming at one point that “The markets are for Zambians” (Larmer and Fraser 2007, 628). We consider this enough to code Sata and the PF 3 on both OTH_ECONOMIC and OTH_ETHNIC. On the latter, there is also evidence that Sata’s rhetoric played into domestic ethnic divisions relating to his Bemba-speaking base, claiming, for example, that Mwanawasa’s anti-corruption in initiatives were an attack on Bemba speakers (Sishuwa 2023, 447). Given the centrality of international financial institutions and foreign governments in his rhetoric (Larmer and Fraser 2007, 613), we’ve also coded Sata and the PF 3 on OTH_FOREIGN. We’ve seen no evidence to code above 1 for OTH_IMMIGRANTS or OTH_MILITARY.\nThe literature frequently emphases the “charismatic” nature of Sata’s political appeal (Hamusokwe and Mambwe 2021, 1; Resnick 2013; Simutanyi 2010, 11), and that the PF was built around him and controlled by him (Larmer and Fraser 2007, 627; Cheeseman and Hinfelaar 2010, 75; Fraser 2017, 458) (CHARISMA = 3). While Sata’s tone was in many ways critical of liberalisation and its effects, the PFs policy was only marginally left leaning and its manifesto committed to “maintain an open, liberal macro-economic environment” alongside its more progressive policies around social services and the party’s “anti-neo-liberal rhetoric,” (Larmer and Fraser 2007, 626, 631). We’ve coded it CL on LRPPOSITION, but this could be revisited. Despite his harsh criticism of those in power, Sata was very much a member of the Zambian political establishment, having served in high profile offices in multiple governments since Independence (Burnell 2002, 1110; Larmer 2005, 42) (INSIDER = 2).\nLong before forming the PF, Sata had an established association with vigilantes (Larmer and Fraser 2007, 624), and he threated to bring back the “militancy” of the colonial past against contemporary rivals in the 2005 (Uzar 2017, 297). According to Larmer and Fraser, during the 2006 campaign pro-Sata minibuses in urban areas “represented a threatening, lawless presence… When MMD cadres attempted to increase their visibility in cities they were soundly chased from the streets. Indeed, on one occasion the President was unable to travel through the capital as PF cadres blocked various routes with minibuses and threatened to stone his motorcade” (Larmer and Fraser 2007, 629). Sata also rejected the results of elections (Sishuwa 2023, 432), and threated to set up a “parallel government” that would make governance impossible (Cheeseman and Hinfelaar 2010, 65). While more research could confirm how much this differs from the common practices in Zambian politics, but for now we have coded Sata and the PF as 3 on LIBDEMNORMS on the basis of this evidence.\nNot included\nThe Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD) was a broad movement that opposed the single party United National Independence Party (UNIP) government and long-term president Kenneth Kaunda in the 1991 elections. The MMD was initially led by the chairman of the Zambia Congress of Trade Union Frederick Chiluba, who defeated Kaunda in a landslide and went on to win the 1996 election too. Chiluba’s 1991 campaign has occasionally been classified as populist in the literature (See for example Makulilo 2013, 75; Vaughan 1999, 253; Larmer and Fraser 2007, 623). It is clear that the MMD campaigned heavily against the UNIP status quo (Chikulo 1993, 91), and that Chiluba had a history of broadly populist statements as a trade unionist (Bratton 1992, 85; Baylies and Szeftel 1992, 86). However, we’ve not seen sufficient evidence in the literature that this campaign or any other MMD campaign was centred on a narrative that would fit our minimum definition of populism. It seems instead that the MMD’s 1992 campaign was a general “change” campaign based on the slogan “the hour has come” (Ihonvbere 1995, 5; Helle and Rakner 2012, 9), driven by general discontent with the outgoing UNIP government without a truly populist narrative against it.\nReferences\nBaylies, Carolyn, and Morris Szeftel. 1992. ‘The Fall and Rise of Multi‐party Politics in Zambia’.
