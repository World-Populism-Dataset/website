<p>A military dictatorship was established in Ecuador in 1972, overthrowing Velasco Ibarra, the great populist figure in the 20<sup>th</sup>Century who had been president on five different occasions and had declared himself as dictator two years before. In 1978, the military called for a referendum and the Ecuadorians chose a new democratic constitution. Presidential elections were held in 1978-1979 and Jaime Roldós, of the Concentration of Popular Forces (CFP) was elected president. Ecuadorian politics include many populist parties. The most relevant ones are CFP, PRE, Patriotic Society Party and Alianza PAIS.</p>
<section id="cfp" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cfp">CFP</h2>
<p>CFP was founded in 1944 by Carlos Guevara Moreno. The party ran on a populist platform promising to break “the tradition of political manipulation of the people” (Sosa-Buchholz, 1999: 148). The party concentrated most of its power in the poor suburbs of Guayaquil and their leaders “refused to identify themselves with the left, right or center”, emphasizing instead Ecuadorian popular ideology and the connection with the “<em>jefe máximo</em>” or supreme leader (Sosa-Buchholz, 1999: 148).</p>
<p>Jaime Roldós participated in the election as candidate because historic CFP leader Assad Bucaram, of Lebanese origin, was banned by the military from participating for not having Ecuadorian parents. The CFP criticized the military by arguing that the decree was an attack on Bucaram. Roldós, who was married to Bucaram’s niece, “expanded upon the techniques already developed by CFP leaders” by cultivating an image of the suburbs (Sosa-Buchholz, 1999: 151). However, soon a conflict arose between Roldós and Bucaram. In addition, their untimely deaths in 1981, marked the division and decline of the CFP. The CFP was then led by Ángel Duarte, a former minister before the military coup who participated in the 1984 and 1988 presidential elections. Although Duarte did not have the charisma of his predecessors (1 in Charisma), he continued with the traditional rhetoric of the CFP and has also been described as populist (Taufic, 1984). I have coded 2 for insider populism because although Duarte was once part of the government, it was before the military coup. He did not have any significant power in the new democracy.</p>
<p>I have not found any opposition to immigrants, ethnic others or foreign threats nor did I find any departure from the incipient Liberal-Democratic norms that the new Ecuadorian democracy was establishing. It is difficult to establish the ideological position of the CFP. I have opted for Centre since they combine elements from both Left and Right, however, N/A would also apply.</p>
</section>
<section id="pre" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pre">PRE</h2>
<p>Abdalá Bucaram, nephew of Assad and brother-in-law of Roldós, led the division of the CFP and created a new party; the Ecuadorian Roldosist Party (PRE). He is considered one of the most important populist figures in Ecuador (Sosa-Buchholz, 1999; De la Torre, 1997; Ulloa, 2017). Abdalá became the mayor of Guayaquil and then presented his candidacy to the presidential election in 1988, 1992 and 1996, finally winning the last year. Abdalá was known as “<em>el loco</em>”, the crazy one, and presented himself as a passionate politician who did not abide by the etiquette of traditional politicians. “He challenges their respectability [of the elite] by glorifying the qualities of the people, insulting his rivals, and acknowledging and accentuating his own ugliness” and employed “simple, humorous, direct, and authentically popular language” (De la Torre, 1997: 17; Moreano and Donoso, 2005). His ideological basis was summed in one of his campaign slogans: “Only one ideology, against the oligarchy” (Sosa-Buchholz, 1999: 153). As he stated once: “The oligarchy is an amorphous entity, an insensitive and exploitative system, an anti-Christian system. ... I think that the oligarchy is everywhere” (Bucaram, 1990: 24). De la Torre (1997: 16) argues that the oligarchy is incarnated mainly in rival politicians thus, for example, “in the 1988 elections, Bucaram presented himself as the child of Christ in struggle against ‘the devil,’ [Socialist leader] Rodrigo Borja.” Bucaram employed a moralistic language to frame the struggle between the people and the elite and contrasted the effeminate nature of the elite with the virility of the Ecuadorian people (De la Torre, 1997: 16).</p>
<p>The ideological classification of Abdalá Bucaram is complicated. Several authors coincide in the diffuse character of his ideology (Moreano and Donoso, 2005; Ulloa, 2017). He has been called a neopopulist because “he campaigned with a leftist discourse but implemented neoliberal measures during his government and formed his team with members of the oligarchy” (Ulloa, 2017: 118). He ran on the promise to improve the living condition of the poor (Sosa-Buchholz, 1999: 153) and had as a campaign slogan “the strength of the poor” (Ulloa, 2017: 117). In government, he applied personalistic measures such as the “Abdalact, cheap milk for Guayaquil’s <em>suburbios</em>, of free back-packs and textbooks, notebooks and pencils bearing the president’s name for poor students” (Sosa-Buchholz, 1999: 154). However, not only did he never question capitalism (De la Torre, 1997: 18), he even implemented strong neoliberal policies by inviting Domingo Cavallo, a former Argentinian finance minister, to advise him. He also showed a great degree of pragmatism forming coalitions with other parties or including members of the former conservative government into his cabinet. I have decided to code him as Centre-Left to reflect his pro-poor policies, although it should be noticed that, as other neopopulists in the 90’s, he shifted significantly once in government.</p>
<p>Although the military did not form the main target of his attacks, he criticized it considerably. In 1985, he flew to Panamá because he was sentenced to four days in prison for saying that the military “had no other use than spend money and march in civic celebrations”. I have coded his position as 2. Abdalá tried to “incarnate the representation of Indians, cholos, whites, blacks and mestizos” (Ulloa, 2017: 120), thus, I have coded 1 for Immigration and Ethnic Others. On his leadership role it is important to point out that the party was created and led by Abdalá. No one disputed his leadership and his style was extremely personalistic. I have coded 3 in charisma.</p>
<p>Abdalá was related to both Assad Bucaram and Jaime Roldós and was mayor of Guayaquil, Ecuador’s second most important city, before running for president in 1988. Therefore, he can be considered as a significant figure in previous governments (2 in Insider Populism). I have not found references or significant attacks on foreign powers or interests (1 in OTH_FOREIGN).</p>
<p>Although several authors point to his “lack of respect for the rights of others” (De la Torre, 1997: 19) or his clientelism (Acosta, 1996), he did not deviate significantly from the liberal-democratic norms of other parties (I coded it as 1). In fact, when his economic austere policies resulted in widespread opposition, he was impeached by the parliament under the vague pretext of his mental incapacity and was substituted by an ‘interim president’ a novel figure for Ecuadorian politics of dubious constitutionality. A new constitution was approved, and elections followed in 1998.</p>
<p>With its leader gone and new elections coming soon, the PRE had to find a replacement and Álvaro Noboa was chosen as the presidential candidate for the 1998 elections. He was one of the most successful businessmen in Ecuador. Nevertheless, he lost that election and then founded the Institutional Renewal Party of National Action, or PRIAN and ran for president in all elections until 2013, coming in in second place in 2002 and in 2006. Noboa has sometimes been described as a populist (Nohlen et al.&nbsp;2005: 372), however, his classification as such is contentious. Although he cultivates an image of a political outsider, in 1998, he stressed his technical abilities of management and differentiated himself from Abdalá Bucaram (Noboa, 1998). More importantly, as Carlos de la Torre argues, Noboa lacks the manichaean confrontation between the people and the power in his discourse (Ecuadorinmediato, 2006). He is better described as a personalistic leader more than as a populist candidate. Thus, I have not included him in the dataset.</p>
<p>I have, however, included the party it the dataset since the party’s position did not change after Abdalá left office. In the 2002 elections, the last in which the party obtained more than 5% of the vote, the party was led by Jacobo Bucaram, Abdalá’s older brother. Jacobo was a sportsman and university chancellor who also became vice-president of the Congress between 1992 and 1993 and was major of the city of Milagro. He was known in the country for beating congressman Jamil Mahuad (who would later become president). He was in favor of the construction of a united Latin American currency that would help redistribute wealth and combat the problem of insecurity (BBC Mundo, 2002). He also wished to renegotiate Ecuador’s debt with the IMF and promote an agrarian revolution (BBC Mundo, 2002). Due to his political career as vice-president of the congress and mayor I have codified him as a 2 in Insider Populism and given that he inherited his brother’s party, I coded him as 1 in Charisma.</p>

<section id="lucio-gutiérrez-and-the-patriotic-society-party" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="lucio-gutiérrez-and-the-patriotic-society-party">Lucio Gutiérrez and the Patriotic Society Party</h2>
<p>Gutiérrez was an unknown coronel without political experience (1 in Insider Populism) who became famous nationwide because of a coup d’état, in a similar fashion to Chávez. In January 2000, in the midst of a deep economic crisis, several factions of the military allied with indigenous movements overthrew the government of Pesident Mahuad. As Gutiérrez (2002) then declared: “from now on you, the people, will always be put first and those who have benefited from the people must step aside”. However, the military was not able to hold power and Mahuad’s vice-president was elected president. Gutiérrez was briefly arrested and later founded the Patriotic Society Party to run for the presidency in the 2002 elections.</p>
<p>De la Torre argues that Gutiérrez “employed the populist rhetoric of confrontation between the people, whom he said he represented, against the oligarchy, symbolized by the corrupt politicians” (De la Torre, 2008: 201). He also exploited the image of the military man as a man of the people who would not sell himself to “antinational interests” as well as his humble origins (De la Torre, 2008: 202). I coded 1 in Military and 2 in Foreign Interests.</p>
<p>The ideological classification of Gutiérrez is not easy because he was able to “coincile opposed tendencies as well as had an enormous flexibility to transform itself” (Montúfar, 2008: 269). He could be described as a neopopulist because of his rhetoric before and after achieving power. He campaigned on a leftist platform, particularly concerned with the indigenous movement’s claims. Moreover, he campaigned against neoliberal measures (De la Torre, 2008: 206). He was, however, less leftist than Chávez, as he himself stated “I admire the courage of Chávez… for challenging a corrupt government. I did the same in Ecuador. But I am not a communist. I am deeply Christian and respect private property and human rights” (El País, 2005). However, once in power, he soon broke his alliance with leftist and indigenous parties and supported himself with right-wing parties (Ulloa, 2017: 124). He then applied measures dictated by the FMI and appointed technocrats with ties to the business powers (Burbano de lara, 2003). The best classification I believe that fits Gutiérrez is to code him as Centre Left in 2002, 3 in Political Class and 2 in Economic Class.</p>
<p>His political platform was strongly based on the indigenous movements, which he identified as the main component of “the people” (De la Torre, 2008: 218) and he did not attack immigrants. 1 in both Immigration and Ethnic Others.</p>
<p>The Patriotic Society Party was created by Gutiérrez as a platform to run for president. The party did not do well in the legislative elections (2.5% of the vote share), which gives an idea of the lack of relevance of the party compared to the figure of its leader. The party later changed its ideological position when Gutiérrez did, which implies that it did not have a solid ideological basis apart from being Gutiérrez’s platform. I have coded 3 in Charisma, since Gutiérrez’s populism was entirely based on his persona.</p>
<p>Gutiérrez’s violation of Liberal-Democratic norms was patently evident. He became known in his country through a coup d’état against the elected president. His downfall also showed his lack of respect for LD norms. Due to corruption scandals, Gutiérrez’s alliance with the conservative parties broke down, and he decided to seek for the help of the PRE and Álvaro Noboa. He then proceeded to substitute judges in the Supreme court and those judges declared null the charges against Abdalá Bucaram. Massive protests followed and Gutiérrez declared the state of exception and ceased the Supreme Court judges. This was seen as an authoritarian intervention to the judicial power and, finally, the congress voted to substitute Gutiérrez with his vice-president, who also had become extremely critical of Gutiérrez’s measures. I have coded 3 in LD Norms.</p>
<p>In the 2006 elections, Gutiérrez was expecting to run for president, but the Supreme Court removed his political rights for two years. His brother Gilmar, who also had participated in Gutiérrez’s 2000 military coup and had been a congressman, had to ran instead (1 in Insider Populism and Charisma). Lucio was, however, able to run on 2009 and 2013 and was the undisputed leader of Patriotic Society Party since he founded the party (3 in Charisma and Insider Populism). During this time, his rhetoric was focused on his opposition to Rafael Correa. Gutiérrez did not lose his populist rhetoric, but the elite was now embodied by the government of Correa whom he accused of corruption (Gutiérrez, 2013a). Lucio called into question the transparency of the elections and criticized Correa for participating in the coup d’état that overthrew his “democratically elected government, thus violating the will of the people” (Gutiérrez, 2013a). Gutiérrez was also a critic of Correa’s closure of media outlets and called into question the impartiality of the Ecuadorian institutions, saying that they only benefited the president but not the people (Gutiérrez, 2013b).</p>
<p>Gutiérrez continued running a populist platform of difficult ideological classification. As Bowen (2010: 187) argues, he “generally eschewed well-defined platforms in favor of personalistic appeals” and “attempted, with some success, to mobilize clientelist networks that he had built during his period as president”. However, he moved from his initial leftist positions to become a critic of Correa’s progressive policies. He argued for the lowering of taxes (Gutiérrez, 2012) and had become, paradoxically, “the preferred candidate among the country's economic elite who see him as the only candidate capable of challenging Correa” (Bowen, 2010: 189). Thus, although he continued to be a populist leader, his definition of elite radically changed, and we could argue that his populism is mainly directed against a political elite (Correa and his government) and not anymore anti-economic class or anti-foreign interest. Therefore, I have changed to 1 Economic Elite and Foreign interest while keeping 3 for Political class and modified his ideology from left to Centre Right.</p>

<section id="rafael-correa-and-pais-alliance" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="rafael-correa-and-pais-alliance">Rafael Correa and PAIS Alliance</h2>
<p>Rafael Correa, who obtained his PhD at the University of Illinois, was a professor of economics in Ecuador when he entered into politics. Probably because of his technocratic profile, he was called by Alfredo Palacio to be Minister of Economy after the downfall of Lucio Gutiérrez. “He was the ultimate outsider—a college economics professor who had never even belonged to a party” (De la Torre, 2013: 35). He remained only four months in the post because he disagreed with the free-trade policies of the government. He then created the movement Alianza PAIS (Patria Altiva i Soberana) or PAIS Alliance (Proud and Sovereign Homeland) and won the 2006 elections. Although he was a minister, I have coded him 1 in Insider Populism because his time as minister was very brief and previously, he had no political experience or public exposure.</p>
<p>His platform has been repeatedly compared to that of Hugo Chávez (De la Torre, 2013; Ulloa, 2017). Correa argued for a “citizens revolution” that called “for the closure of Congress followed by elections for a constituent assembly that would write a new basic law. The underlying goal was to break the ‘partidocracia’ or system of domination by political parties.” (De la Torre, 2013: 36). Since his intention was to call for a constituent assembly that would create a new constitution and change the way the political system worked up until then, PAIS Alliance did not present any candidate for the legislative body. This indicated his aim to connect directly with the people bypassing the formal institutions of representation. Ulloa (2017: 127) points out the importance of Correa’s charisma and the concentration of party power in his hands (3 in Charisma).</p>
<p>His aim was to “refound the homeland” in order to achieve “a radical and rapid change in the existing structures of Ecuadorean society, in order to change the bourgeois state into a truly popular one.” (Correa, 2012). In his inaugural speech, he claimed that Ecuador needed to “get its homeland back” (Correa, 2006a) and argued that, under his government, “the fatherland was no longer for sale” (Correa, 2006a). “Correa presented himself as a leftist candidate, anti-international credit organizations, defendant of sovereignty; he employed an anti-political discourse that was, above all, anti-party” (Ulloa, 2017: 128). Correa defined himself as “socialist from a Christian, not Marxist, source; I like to define myself as a leftist Christian humanist” (Correa, 2006) whose platform was based primarily on fighting corruption and reversing neoliberal policies. He claimed that “we will never forget the crimes of the corrupt bankers who bankrupt us” (Correa, 2006a). Moreover, he stated that neoliberal policies whose “consequences have been disastrous” “were not only imposed but were also enthusiastically applauded by our elites” (Correa, 2006a). Thus, Correa claimed for a second Independence of Ecuador (De la Torre, 2013: 44) by which “Ecuador will become independent from international organizations, that represent foreign paradigms and interests” (Correa, 2006a). The most appropriate coding for Correa seems to be Far Left in Ideology and 3 in Political Class, Economical Class and Foreign Interests.</p>
<p>Correa had good relations with the military at the beginning of his presidency and although it later deteriorated due to spending cuts (ABC, 2016), the military was not a target of his populist speech.</p>
<p>Another of the pillars of Rafael Correa’s platform was what in Quechua is called the “<em>sumak kawsay</em>, which literally means ‘the life well lived’” (De la Torre, 2013: 39). The concept “comes from indigenous cosmology, and aims to build ‘the good life,’ understood as non-Western relationships between society, nature, and development.” (De la Torre, 2013: 39). This pillar was concretized in Ecuador’s new constitution with the definition of the country as ‘plurinational’ and the inclusion of “nature rights”. Additionally, Correa included a leader of the indigenous movement as president of the constituent assembly and finished his inaugural speech with some words in Quechua (Correa, 2006a). His relations with the indigenous communities deteriorated later due to disagreements over mineral extraction which the indigenous communities opposed to, but which Correa’s government thought necessary for the independence of the country (De la Torre, 2013: 41). However, neither immigration nor other ethnic communities were ever identified by Correa as part of the elite.</p>
<p>Although Correa claimed to seek the democratization of Ecuador, his actions in government fall short of his electoral promises (De la Torre, 2013; Ulloa, 2017). Moreover, he launched several attacks on the media because, as he put it “the media have always been one of the de facto powers that have dominated Latin American countries.” (quoted in De la Torre, 2013: 42). Members of ‘El Universo’ were convicted of defamation for an editorial they wrote, and the newspaper was heavily fined as well. Moreover, every week Correa hosted ‘Enlace Ciudadano’ a three-hour show in which he criticized the media’s representation of his government treating them as political actors (Ulloa, 2017: 289). Insults and mocking of other political leaders were very common in his shows.</p>
<p>Furthermore, his call for a constituent assembly has been questioned for its legality (Ulloa, 2017: 136,137). That possibility was not one of the prerogatives of the president in the constitution and it completely bypassed the legislative body. However, he went ahead with his plans due to his massive popular support. De la Torre (2013: 33) argues that Correa represents a case of “soft authoritarianism” similar to that of Chávez. Taking into consideration his attacks on the press, I have coded him as 3 in Lib-Dem Norms.</p>
<p>Carlos de la Torre (2017: 39) points out that Correa, himself an ‘expert’ in economics as an academic, exhibited a kind of technocratic populism by which he had the knowledge to rebuild his nation and bring progress and modernization. Thus, he combined technocracy with populism. Lenín Moreno, vice-president during most of Correa’s years in power and UN special delegate on disability issues would represent this technocratic element in his government. Moreno won the 2017 elections with Alliance PIAS. Moreno has a leftist ideology and continues with many of Correa’s policies; however, he is less charismatic than his predecessor and does not employ the level of confrontational rhetoric that Correa did. Although many saw him as the marionette of Correa, he soon started to differentiate himself from Correa in what De la Torre (2018) calls Ecuador’s ‘perestroika’. Moreno has strongly persecuted corruption, removed the asylum to Julian Assange and engaged in a dialogue with all political forces, including Right-wing parties, moves that have been strongly criticized by Correa. Moreno’s case can be compared to that of Juan Manuel Santos in Colombia and his relationship with Álvaro Uribe, where a non or less populist leader inherited the party that the populist leader created. Following the criteria used with Santos and acknowledging that Moreno has inherited mainly Correa’s ideological basis but not so much his populism, I have not included him in the dataset. I have, however. Included Alliance PAIS in the legislative elections as a way to show that the party is still very much influenced by Correa’s personality (I changed Charisma from 3 to 1 to indicate the difference in importance of the leader). Whether Moreno will be able to change the character of the party in the future or not is an open question.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mpd">MPD</h2>
<p>The Popular Democratic Movement is not included in the dataset because it has been described as a “traditional party” based on a communist and Maoist ideology (De la Torre, 2013: 34-35) with strong connections with the country’s unions. Although it briefly supported Lucio Gutiérrez and Rafael Correa, it later became part of the opposition to these populist leaders. None of the sources consulted describes this party as populist.</p>
