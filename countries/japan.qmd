## Japan Restoration Party/ Japan Innovation Party

The only national Japanese party that could be considered populist by
the dataset's standards is the Japan Restoration Party (*Nippon* *Ishin
no Kai*, JRP). JRP was is the national successor to the Osaka
Restoration Party (*Osaka Ishin no Kai,* also translated "One Osaka
Party") (Jou 2015), both built around then Mayor of Osaka and former
Governor of Osaka Prefecture, T≈çru Hashimoto. Hashimoto is a former
television personality and lawyer who split from the dominant Liberal
Democratic Party to run successfully for Governor in 2007. ORP was a
regionalist party with a neoliberal reformist agenda. As his national
brand grew, he created the JRO as a merger of the ORP with the
nationalist Sunrise Movement of Tokyo Governor Shintarou Ishihara before
the 2012 election. While Ishihara was technically the leader of the
national party, most analyses seem to consider Hashimoto to have been
the "face of the party during the election" (R. J. Pekkanen and Reed
2016, 66), and the continuity of the *Ishin* name suggests as much. The
party did surprisingly well, leading some to consider it a brief "third
force" in Japanese politics (Komatsu 2017, 165). Note that the English
name "restoration" was chosen by the party, but *Ishin* actually means
"innovation" in Japanese (Kobori 2013, 108), and some literature refers
to the party as the Japanese Innovation Party. To complicate matters,
when Hashimoto pulled his faction out of the JRF following strategic
disputes with Ishihara's Tokyo wing of the party, the new party he
founded was called the "Japan Innovation Party" (JIP) (Fahey et al.
2021, 319). This party stood in the subsequent 2014 elections, and
although a new party, evidence suggests that Hashimoto absorbed the
newly merged faction into his own operation more than vice versa, and
hence we've considered it a continuation of the JRP in the dataset
(except on CHARISMA, as discussed below). Hashimoto's popularity
declined following the 2014 election, and after his signature policy of
uniting Osaka prefecture and Osaka city was defeated in a referendum in
2015, he announced he would leave politics.

Hashimoto's populism was rooted in his harsh and acerbic criticism of
the political class. His primary antagonists in this regard were
national political parties, bureaucrats, and unions (Jou 2015, 149), as
well as local councils and academics (Yoshida, 2019:3). His success was
due to the "theatrical" (Klein 2015, 3) way in which he berated his
opponents with "sometimes-violent criticisms" (Yoshida 2020, 3)
"especially before television crews" (Weathers 2014, 82) and on social
media (Fahey et al. 2021, 327). This rhetoric accused government
employees (probably his main "other") of not caring about their jobs
(Weathers 2014, 82), of being overpaid (Kobori 2013, 112), and of being
"termites of public finance" (Pons 2012). Further to these insults, he
repeatedly claimed or implied that public servants actively and
intentionally maintained the status quo for their own material interest
(Kobori 2013, 112; Ichihara 2021, 92). Likewise, he claimed that
politicians in the major parties were untrustworthy, suggesting before
the 2011 Osaka Prefecture elections, for example, that "We can't entrust
things to Diet politicians. Isn't it only the people of Osaka Prefecture
who can get this country moving?" (Weathers 2014, 84). In 2012 he
campaigned on the slogan "If you are fed up with the two major parties,
vote JRP" (Reed 2013, 81). This anti-politician message has led many
observers to consider him and the JRP "anti-establishment" (Lindgren
2015, 577). In Fahey's words, Hashimoto "depicted politics as a
good-versus-evil struggle between his reforms and the entrenched,
self-serving bureaucrats and public servants," (Fahey et al. 2021, 327).
(OTH_POLCLASS = 3).

The party's key ideological hallmarks were nationalism (Horiuchi 2014,
29; Jou 2015, 156) and neoliberalism (Weathers 2014; Lindgren 2015), due
to which it is usually considered to be right-wing (Kobori 2013, 117;
Chiavacci 2022, 127) (LRPOSITION = R). Other than the political class
and state bureaucrats, other "others" in Hashimoto's and the JRP's
discourse are somewhat more difficult to clarify. His nationalism was
not "hard core" in the mould of Ishihara (Horiuchi 2014, 29), but by the
time of the 2012 election the JRP was clearly a hawkish anti-China party
which mobilised heavily around the sensitive Senkaku Islands issue
(Horiuchi 2014, 33). However, we have seen no evidence that the party
accused domestic rivals of being loyal to these foreign powers, and
hence we've coded it 2 on OTH_FOREIGN.

Likewise, while some scholars have suggested that Hashimoto was
something of a nativist (Lindgren 2015, 586), others have stressed that
"despite his embrace of many nationalist views, Hashimoto strongly
opposed xenophobic movements" (Fahey et al. 2021, 328--29). While he
probably deserves a 1 on the OTH_ETHNIC and OTH_IMMIGRANT variables in
his own right, JRP's coding is complicated by its amalgamation with
Ishihara's hard right sunrise movement, which was known for harsher
nativist rhetoric in this regard (Lindgren 2015). Owing to this we've
coded the JRP 2 on both scales for 2012, but this could be revisited.
Given that the JIP did not include Ishihara, we've reduced these
variables to 1 in the 2014 election. JRP was clearly "pro-business"
(Yoshida 2020, 3; see also Jou 2015, 150) and did not show any major
hostility to the wealthy (OTH_FINANCIAL = 1) or the military
(OTH_MILITARY = 1).

The ORP was clearly a "leader-defined party" (Jou 2015, 145). Numerous
sources note that Hashimoto's "aggressive and impatient political style"
made him Japan's "most popular politician" in 2012 (Weathers 2014, 77;
see also Fahey et al. 2021, 327), and that he was notably "charismatic"
(Horiuchi 2014, 29). However, the JRP being a merger with the Sunrise
party again complicated the coding here for the 2012 election. Jou
claims that this co-leadership model means that JRP cannot truly be
considered a leader-defined party, even though Hashimoto's charisma was
a key reason why voters supported it (Jou 2015). Conversely, Reed (Reed
2013, 72) claims that the party didn't really have a coherent policy
profile, and that "personality" was a dominant reason why most of its
voters supported it. While there may be a case to code it 2 on CHARISMA,
we've coded it 3. However once the JIP formed for the 2014 election,
Pekkanen and Reed suggest that it was new partner Kenji Eda, not
Hashimoto, who was the "face of the party durin the election" R. J.
Pekkanen and Reed 2016, 69), and hence we've reduced CHARISMA to 1 for
that vote. Hashimoto was not a figure in previous national governments
at the time of the 2012 or 2014 elections (INSIDER = 1).

Hashimoto pushed Japanese liberal democratic norms in several ways.
Ideologically, he advocated what he called a "decisionist" ideal of
political control (Kobori 2013, 114), where elected leaders (like him)
would not be as constrained by checks on their power (Fahey et al. 2021,
327). "His distaste for institutions that limit executive power was
clear" claims Fahey (Fahey et al. 2021, 327). On 30 June 2011, he
notoriously said, "the most important thing in Japanese politics is
dictatorship" (Kobori 2013, 114). He also abused the rights of
government employees in Osaka by subjecting them to full body searches
for tattoos (Kobori 2013, 113; Fahey et al. 2021, 328), and attempting
to force them to complete a non-anonymised questionnaire about their
political affiliations and activities (Kobori 2013, 112). In addition
not this he aggressively denounced media outlets critical of this
administration (Fahey et al. 2021, 327; Yamakoshi 2019, 12). All of this
led him to labelled "*hashizumu"* by some critics -- a portmanteau of
his name and *fashizumu* (fascism) (Weathers 2014, 83). While this is
clearly evidence of threats to liberal democratic norms, we don't feel
that it quite rises to 3 on the LIBDEMNORMS scale (= 2).

## Not included

The nature of the **Japanese Socialist Party** (JPA) is not really
populist, and the same can be said of the **Japanese Communist Party**
(JCP). Like other socialist parties worldwide, their platform is
predominantly ideological and issues-based, even if they imply a kind of
anti-elitism in their economic policy. In the case of the JPA, the two
issues that are arguably its raison d\'etre are the evils of free-market
capitalism and militarism. The party did dilute its socialist rhetoric
as time went on, however, dropping its comittment to socialist
revolution in 1989. But this was more acquiesence to the political
estabilishment than response to some bubbling populist sentiment. The
JCP, on the other hand, has remained steadfastly ideological. It did
express willingness in 2016 to form a coalition with the Democratic
Party to challenge the dominance of the LDP/Kometio coalition, but the
leader of the DP rejected the possiblity due to the JCP being too far
left.

The growth of the **Democratic Party** through the 2000s into government
in 2009 has been called populist by some, but this is only really so
because of how staid and conservative Japanese politics is generally
under LDP dominant part rule. Several actors within the long-ruling
**Liberal Democratic Party** (LDP) have been considered populist. The
first is **Jun\'ichiro Koizumi** emerged at a time when severe economic
downturn reduced the public\'s faith in the political establishment and
the bureaucracy (Kato 2018). He ran on a neo-liberal reformist platform
(advocating privatisations of key sectors) and assailing the more
patrimonial bosses in the LDP, against whom he commanded deep
member-based support. While Koizumi often used terms that might be
considered populist, and occasionally hit touchstone nationalist issues
(like visiting the Yasukuni shrine), his style seems to have more in
common with a Ronald Reagan-style outsider politician reformer (Otake
2009; Fahey et al. 2021), and not a populist as we define the term.
According to Otake, he avoided "highly inflammatory" rhetoric while
criticising his opponents (cited in Weathers 2014, 82), contrasting him
with populists like Hashimoto and Ishihara. Likewise, Koizumi\'s
successor **Shinzo Abe** has a strong nationalist streak similar to
far-right populist parties, but not one that could render him or the LDP
categorically populist under his leadership. Interestingly, it seems
that Abe\'s ability to command this nationalist flank is the reason why
far right groups don\'t get much traction, even though several very
small ones have emerged of late. The **Komeito Party** (both the
original and the New Komeito) is tough to code because it defies
conventional party typologies. There is a case to consider it a populist
party because its mantra is the representation of "common people",
there's no evidence that it engages in anti-elite rhetoric.
