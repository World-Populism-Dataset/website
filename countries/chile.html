<p>Chile suffered a military dictatorship at the hands of General Augusto Pinochet from 1973 until 1990. In 1988 a referendum was held on whether to continue with Pinochet’s dictatorship, which was won by the NO. The first democratic elections were held in 1989 and Patrio Aylwin, a center-left Christian Democrat, became president. Chile has traditionally been considered an exception to the succession of populist leaders in other Latin American countries. As Drake (1999: 72) argues, “populism did not disrupt the transition to democracy or occupy center stage”. “Centrist and leftist politicians did not want populism to upset the new democracy any more than they wanted to disturb macroeconomic equilibrium” (Drake, 1999: 72). Thus, none of the big coalition of Chilean parties is considered populist by most scholars. However, although no populist leader has held the presidency since 1990, there are a number of less successful candidates that should be included in that category.</p>
<section id="francisco-javier-errázuriz" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="francisco-javier-errázuriz">Francisco Javier Errázuriz</h2>
<p>Along with the candidates of the right and left, Francisco Javier Errázuriz, a wealthy businessman that came from a highly influential family in Chile, claimed to represent the “centre-centre” of politics (Drake, 1999: 73). Before running for president, Errázuriz held no political position (1 in Insider Populism). The movement was a surprise at the time and, not being backed by any party, his campaign was purely based on his personal figure (3 in Personality Dependent).</p>
<p>Errázuriz appealed an antiparty undercurrent based on “vaguely nationalistic, reformist, anticorruption, antipolitician platform aimed at broad segments of the middle classes and unorganized workers” (Drake, 1999: 73). His platform was based on praising the free-market system and promising social justice (Drake, 1999: 73). He put himself, a wealthy businessman, as an example of an accomplished life and claimed to be able to show Chileans the way to the same wealth and wellbeing (Errázuriz, 1989a). I have labelled 3 for Political Class, and 1 for Foreign Interests and Economical Elite.</p>
<p>Errázuriz’s discourse, although anti-politician, was conciliatory. He argued against the polarization of society in two blocks: “do not divide the country in two sides… we need unity” (Errázuriz, 1989a) and he claimed that he did not call voters to vote against nobody (Errázuriz, 1989b). Although he has been later involved in several cases of corruption, there is nothing in his 1989 campaign that indicates a violation of LD norms. However, his aim to leave the past behind also means that he did not condemn the military dictatorship, nor it consider it part of the establishment (1 in Military). I have not been able to find any negative reference to either immigrants or Ethnic others.</p>

<section id="joaquín-lavín" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="joaquín-lavín">Joaquín Lavín</h2>
<p>The Independent Democratic Union or (UDI) was founded in 1982 as one of the parties that defended the military dictatorship. The party was “inspired by Spanish Franquismo corporatism” and “its founding leader, Jaime Guzmán, was the political ideologue of the authoritarian regime” (Luna et al.&nbsp;2013: 923). The UDI “was born in the midst of neo-conservatism, and in the context of a conservative turn within the Catholic Church” (Luna et al.&nbsp;2013: 929). Moreover, the party “developed close ties with business interests which partially explains its electoral performance since 1989 in the upper sectors of the Chilean society and its financial campaign advantages” (Luna et al.&nbsp;2013: 924) but also aimed at attracting the poorer sections of society through the financing of specific programs targeted to the poor (Luna, 2010: 326). As a defender of the military establishment and Pinochet’s legacy, the party cannot be considered populist in its first elections. Scholars agree that it is Joaquin Lavin’s leadership which introduces an “anti-politics discourse” in the campaigns (Silva, 2001; Luna, 2010; Luna et al.&nbsp;2013; Cortés and Pelfini, 2017).</p>
<p>Joaquin Lavin’s professional evolution follows that of other Chicago boys-technocrats. He studied at Chicago, became dean of School of Economics at a Chilean University, participated in Pinochet’s administration, became secretary general of the UDI from 1990 to 1994 and acted as mayor of a municipality in the 90s. He did not, however, participate in the inner circle of Pinochet’s government (1 for Insider Populism). The UDI was very much attached to Pinochet’s legacy but his arrest in London in 1988 introduced a change in the political discourse of the party, by which the praises to the dictatorship were kept to a minimum (Silva, 2001: 28) and a more moderated image for the party was crafted (Luna, 2010: 346). The crisis and several cases of corruption in the previous government gave way to Lavin’s anti-political and neo-populist strategy “expressed in his abhorrence of politics and political parties, and his inclination to 'technify' social problems and their solutions” (Silva, 2001: 33). He claimed to be concentrating on the real problems of the people by addressing particular issues instead crafting large plans. His is a combination of technocratic and populist rhetoric (Silva, 2001: 33). The party self-proclaimed itself as the “popular party” in order to enhance its identification with the people and it proclaimed to overcome the left-right divide (Cortés and Pelfini, 2017: 67). I have coded 3 for Political Class, 1 for Financial Elite and Foreign Interests, given its strictly orthodox neoliberal commitments and 2 for Personality Dependent since it was Lavin who introduced the novel anti-politics discourse to an already established party. Without him, the party would have continued to exist, but it would not have taken its populist stance.</p>
<p>Neither immigration nor indigenous communities were a central element in Lavin’s campaign, and he has shown itself to be in favor of a better recognition for the Mapuches (Emol, 2013) and for a regulated open immigration policy. I have not found any indication of Violation of LD norms. In fact, when he lost the election, he stood in the balcony of the winner, Ricardo Lagos, as a way of signaling his commitment to collaborate with the new government in a friendly manner (Silva, 2001: 35). I have coded 1 in these three categories.</p>
<p>Luna et al.&nbsp;(2013) point out that Lavin’s candidacy implied a disrupture in UDI’s traditional politics. This disrupture did not continue after Lavín’s failed bids for president. In 2009, the leader of the Alliance for Chile, was the candidate from the National Renovation, Sebastián Piñera. In 2013, Evelyn Matthei, a former minister under Piñera’s government and member of UDI, was the candidate of the alliance and again in 2017 Piñera was presented as the candidate for the right-wing coalition. Both have explicitly rejected populist rhetoric (Emol, 2013b; Romainville, 2018) and they are not treated as populist in the scholarship. Moreover, it is not clear until what point the party did change its position to a populist one under Lavín. It is perfectly possible to consider Lavín’s anti-political discourse exclusive of the leader and not of the party. However, considering Lavín’s role as the leader of the party as the leader of the opposition for several years, I have decided to leave the UDI in the dataset for the 2001 and 2005 legislative elections. However, I have not added the party before or after Lavín’s period.</p>

<section id="communist-party-together-we-can-do-more-for-chile" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="communist-party-together-we-can-do-more-for-chile">Communist Party / Together we can do more for Chile</h2>
<p>There has been extensive debate over whether Communist and/or Socialist ideologies are similar or dissimilar to populist discourses. Hawkins and Rovira-Kaltwasser (2017) argue that the combination of Marxism and populism is common in Chile, being Salvador Allende its prime example.</p>
<p>The Communist Party of Chile is “a revolutionary Party, which fights for socialism and recognizes the driving role of the working class” (Communist Party of Chile, 2002) that aims at the “suppression of all forms of political, economic, social and cultural domination over the people” (Communist Party of Chile, 2002). Although Marxist parties tend to downplay their national ties in favor of internationalism while populist parties are usually more nationalistic, the Chilean Communist Party aims at combining the two by stating that its inspiration is “national, patriotic, Latin Americanist and internationalist” (Communist Party of Chile, 2002). Furthermore, the party is “anti-imperialistic” and “fights for the self-determination of the peoples and is in solidarity with all those who fight for their national independence, for democracy, for socialism and peace.” (Communist Party of Chile, 2002). I have coded 3 for Financial Elite, Foreign Interests and Political Class and “Far-Left” as its ideology.</p>
<p>Although the Communist party is a revolutionary party and “its sustained on the ideas of Marx, Engels and Lenin” (Communist Party of Chile, 2002), it also proclaims that “because of its tradition and democratic spirit, it fights for democracy as a form of political organization of society” and that “its humanistic conception contains the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights” (Communist Party of Chile, 2002). I have not found actions carried out by the Communist Party in this period that imply a violation of LD norms. I have coded this category as a 2.</p>
<p>The party suffered persecution during the dictatorship and could not compete in the first elections under its name. Since Allende’s government, the Communist party did not participate in the administration and was not led by any charismatic leader. Therefore, I have coded 3 for Military, and 1 for Insider Populism and Personality Dependent.</p>
<p>In 2005, the party forms an electoral alliance with the Humanist party called “Together we can do more for Chile” (“Juntos Podemos Más por Chile”) and presented their leader, Tomás Hirsch, as their candidate for president. There were many ideological similarities between these two parties and the Communist party remained as the largest party in the coalition. Moreover, Hirsh campaigned on a progressive left-wing platform similar to that of the Communist party (Angell and Reig, 2006). Thus, I have kept the same coding as in the previous elections.</p>
<p>In 2009, 2013 and 2017 parliamentary elections, the Communist Party became part of the electoral alliance of the “Concertación” and “Nueva Mayoría” but obtained less than 5% of the votes. For the presidential elections, the party presented a candidate, supported Bachelet’s candidacy for 2013 and her successor’s in 2017. Thus, I have not coded the Communist party for these years. In 2009, “Together we can do more for Chile” presented Jorge Arrate as their presidential candidate. He ran on similar ideas to what the party defended before.</p>
</section>
<section id="marco-enríquez-ominami" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="marco-enríquez-ominami">Marco Enríquez-Ominami</h2>
<p>Marco Enríquez-Ominami, or MEO, as he is commonly known, is the son of a guerrilla warrior killed by the military dictatorship. His family was forced into exile and when he went back to Chile, he became known as a TV host and as a movie director. He became a member of parliament in 2005 for the Socialist Party. In 2009, the left-wing electoral alliance denied the possibility of holding fair primary elections and instead chose former president Eduardo Frei as their candidate. Enríquez-Ominami decided then to run for the presidency as an independent obtaining the third position in the elections. He ran again in 2013 and in 2017, although less successfully. I have labelled 1 for Insider Populism and 2 for Personality Dependent because the movement grew up from a general social discontent with political parties at the time but his electoral platform was entirely based on his persona.</p>
<p>The campaign of MEO was personalist, mediatic, with a strong emotional speech, based on the closeness to the people and facing its other contenders whom it identified as "figures of the past" (Dosek and Freidenberg, 2014: 22). He wishes to distance himself from the old political elite, which he considered that had “kidnapped politics and did not offer a change for Chile” (Dosek and Freidenberg, 2014: 23). He denounced that millions of Chileans were “outside of the political process” and campaign to end that situation (Enríquez-Ominami, 2009).</p>
<p>MEO ran on a left-wing platform, based on promising free public education and an increase of the minimum salary (Manifesto, 2009) but his platform is not radical. He wished to “raise corporate taxes but lower the income tax” and he “also expressed an openness to having the state divest itself of a small stake of its copper Company” (Moffett and Pica, 2009). Thus, his main target is the political class but not the economic elite.</p>
<p>Enríquez-Ominami has a favorable position towards immigration and indigenous communities in Chile, arguing that “a great deal of the history of Chile is written together with Mapuches and immigrants” (CNN, 2017). I have labelled 1 for Immigration and Ethnic Others. I have not found any reference that could be used to identify the military as an enemy of the people in MEO’s discourse.</p>
<p>Enríquez-Ominami has proclaimed the need to democratize the country, regenerate politics, “combat social inequality and promoting regional political unity” (Moffett and Pica, 2009). I have labelled 1 in LD norms and 1 in Foreign Interests since he is in favor of deeper regional integration and an open economy.</p>
</section>
<section id="broad-front" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="broad-front">Broad Front</h2>
<p>The Broad Front (“Frente Amplio”) is a coalition of left-wing parties created in 2017 in order to compete in the elections. Its origins can be traced to the student protests of 2011 and the coalition includes a wide variety of left and far-left parties with the exception of the Communist party, which participated in the centre-left coalition. González Le Saux exposes the Broad Front’s vision of the economic and political system in Chile:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“From Frente Amplio's perspective, the bipartisan logic of compromise between the two ruling coalitions has allowed the neoliberal model-cemented during the country's 17-year dictatorship under Augusto Pinochet (1973-1990)-to continue, with only moderate reforms aimed at mitigating its most draconian consequences. Frente Amplio seeks to overcome a transitional order characterized by a neoliberal economy, export-driven extractivism, and the privatization of social rights in the realms of education, health, labor, and social security” González Le Saux, (2017).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is a party that criticises harshly the establishment and wishes a radical rupture with it: “Frente Amplio is appealing to the novelty and integrity of its candidates, unpolluted by the links between money and politics. Against the paternalistic and top down functioning of traditional parties, it promotes a participatory style of politics” (González Le Saux, 2017). The Broad Front, thus, has a “left-wing agenda of anti-neoliberalism, environmentalism, pro-immigrant and LGBTQI rights” (González Le Saux, 2017). I have coded 3 for Political Class, Financial Elite and “Far-left” as ideology.</p>
<p>The presidential candidate was Beatriz Sánchez, a radio and TV host that identified herself as “left-wing, but a very democratic left” and who stresses the importance of discussion as a way of reaching agreements (The Global Vote, 2017) (1 in Violation of LD norms). Sánchez never held a position in government and did not belong to any party before 2017 (1 in Insider Populism). Since the party was created independently of Sánchez and would have existed without her, I have coded 1 in Personality Dependent.</p>
<p>She declares herself as a feminist candidate for the presidency and is a defender of LGTB rights and abortion (The Global Vote, 2017). Additionally, she is particularly critic with the sharp inequalities in Chile: “The concentration of wealth is one of the highest in Latin America. [The rich should] pay fair taxes. I don’t want them not to earn money, but to pay fair taxes.” (The Global Vote, 2017).</p>
<p>The army received harsh criticism from Sanchez due to the lack of governmental control over it (Sanchez, 2016). Moreover, she also argued against the privileges the army has in comparison with other public servants such as a better pension scheme or healthcare system (Sanchez, 2016). The reason for this, she argued, was that “there isn’t a real dominion of the Civil power over the military power” and urged to change that situation (Sanchez, 2016). I have labelled 3 for Military.</p>
<p>On Foreign Interests, “the agenda is predominantly domestic, with relatively little reference made to international affairs or Chile’s role in the world” (The Global Vote, 2017). I have not found nationalist rhetoric nor the identification of external threats in Sanchez’s discourse (1 for Foreign Interests).</p>
</section>
<section id="josé-antonio-kast" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="josé-antonio-kast">José Antonio Kast</h2>
<p>José Antonio Kast is a lawyer from a prominent political family in Chile. He was a city councillor, a member of the chamber of deputies for 14 years and secretary general of the UDI. Kast was a well-known figure of the most conservative current of the UDI and left the party in 2016 in order to run for president in the 2017 campaign on a more right-wing and populist platform. He has professed many times its admiration for Bolsonaro’s defeat of the “corrupt left” (Tele13, 2018).</p>
<p>Kast is a strong supporter of the dictatorship of Pinochet, saying that if Pinochet were alive, he would vote for him (Freixas, 2019). He participated in the campaign for the YES to the dictatorship in the 1988 referendum and his brother, as one of the “Chicago Boys”, actively participated in Pinochet’s government. Moreover, he asked for the liberation of one of the torturers of the dictatorship (Freixas, 2019). Kast is in favor of increasing military spending, stating that “the armed forces, in justified cases and as a strictly exceptional measure, will be able to collaborate in matters of public security when they are required in order to fight terrorism and drug trafficking. Improvements, innovation and new powers and attributions require a bigger budget. To this end, the limits of the use of the Fund created by the Copper Reserve Law will be revised so that these resources can be used to increase the available military budget” (The Global Vote, 2017). 1 for Military.</p>
<p>Kast is strongly opposed to abortion, feminism and LGBT rights and considers the right-wing president, Sebastían Piñera as a “soft right” for “lack of character” and for giving in to pressures from the opposition” (Freixas, 2019). After the 2017 election, he created a new party called Republican Action and its logo clearly references that of the French Front National. On economic issues, he is committed to neoliberal policies and argues for a small state that is free from “politicking, privileges, duplicities or useless agencies” (Kast, 2017).</p>
<p>Given all the above I have coded Far Right as ideology, 3 for Political Class, 3 for Violation of LD norms and 1 for Financial Elite and Military.</p>
<p>On the relation between Chile and its neighbors, Kast displays a nationalistic view and identifies physical barriers as the solution to the long-standing territorial dispute with neighboring Bolivia. Kast stated that “we want to reaffirm the autonomy of Chile and its sovereignty that must be exercised in every corner of the country. For a long time, we have been passive spectators of the communication abuses of our neighbors of the northeast and we have not responded with sufficient force and decision to the lies of the Bolivian government… Physical barriers are required on the Chile-Peru and the Chile-Bolivia border to support our police and to help to fight drug trafficking and smuggling at the border. In addition, we need to incorporate more technology for the detection and prosecution of border crimes” (The Global Vote, 2017). 3 for Foreign Interests.</p>
<p>He is in favor of controlling migration, commenting that “those people who are going to come must know that as of today, Chile is not ready to receive all people.” (The Global Vote, 2017). “But we must also be rigorous in controlling our borders and in rejecting illegal immigration in every event (The Global Vote, 2017). Additionally, Kast has been criticized for”constructing a hate discourse regarding race, ethnicity or sexual minorities” (Freixas, 2019). I have coded 3 for Immigration and Ethnic Others.</p>
<p>Although Kast did not participate in the government, he was a prominent member of the UDI for many years and secretary general of the party before he decided to run as an independent. I have decided to code him as 2 in Insider Populism. It is plausible to imagine that other far-right parties could have emerged in the 2017 elections, but Kast’s movement was based on his personas as he ran as an independent and then founded the party Republican Action. I believe this deserved a 2 in Personality Dependent.</p>
