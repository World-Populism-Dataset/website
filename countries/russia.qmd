title: Russia

Electoral competition has not been free in Russia in the Putin era, and
there are numerous candidates who have not been allowed to stand, some
of whom are arguably populists (Alexei Navalny for example).
Corresponding election boycotts should also be taken into consideration
when looking at trends.

## Vladirim Zhirinovsky / Liberal Democratic Party

The Liberal Democratic Party of Vladmir Zhirinovsky has been a feature
of Russian politics since the end of the USSR. Having been a critic of
the ruling Communist Party in its last decade in power, Zhirinovsky was
a candidate in the first democratic elections in 1991, where he was a
notably flamboyant "common folk" opposition to the standard boring
communist politician (Eatwell, 2002:6). His campaign featured populist
measures about fighting crime, cutting the price of vodka, and finding
husbands for unmarried women (Kipp, 1994:74; Eatwell, 2002:6). He also
developed a radically ethno-nationalist stance (Kipp, 1994:77),
advoating re-conquering the former imperial lands of the old Russian
Empire (and even more by conquering Iran and Afghanistan) (Koman, 1996)
and praises of Hitler (Eatwell, 2002:7), combined with a chauvinistic
measure of racism, anti-semitism, anti-Islam and sexism (Alexeev,
2006:211). He measured 3 on the OTH_FOREIGN for his opinions of the
West, post-soviet successor states in the CIS, neighbouring Islamic
states (Turkey and Iran in particular), and China (Koman, 1996; Alexeev,
2006:212). I've seen no evidence that his politics has exhibited any
OTH_FINANCIAL elements, and according to Eatwell (2002:7) business
elites were a source of support for the LDP in its early years. The
LDP's economic platform has been characterised as a kind of
state-capitalism supportive of privatisation (Kipp, 1994:79).

While the party has well-defined ideological foundations, the
flamboyant, controversial, and media-savy personality of Zhirinovsky has
clearly been paramount in holding the party together (CHARISMA = 3)
(Kipp, 1994:86; Eatwell, 2002:7), especially considering that it has
rivals on the far right. I've labelled his OTH_POLCLASS score as high in
initial elections but receding from around the 1995 election, as it
seemed that this peaked in the initial post-communist era. Over the
years he's become so stable and unthreatening in the party system that
he could hardly the anti-establishment figure that he used to be. Behind
the scenes he seems to have worked reasonably closely with both Yeltsin
(Eatwell, 2002:9) and Putin (Colton & Hale 2014). Colton and Hale even
suggest that Zhirinovski is Putin's "officially tolerated nationalist",
given that the absorbes some protest votes while remaining cooperative
(2014:7). He is somewhat difficult to characterise on LIBDEMNORMS given
the fragile state of these norms in Russia. In spite of this, I've
labelled him 3 throughout his career given his vocal suggestions that
his desired reconstituted Russian Empire requires centralised political
control with no separation of powers (Kipp, 1994:77).

## Alexander Lebed

Alexander Lebed, a former general who ran for president in 1996 under
the **Congress of Russian Communities** party, is a tricky one to
characterise. He ran a generally centre-right campaign with a common-man
"outsider" appeal grounded in general sense of Russian nationalism
linked to his military service (particularly in Moldova, where he
favoured the ethnic Russians in Transnistria in defiance of more
moderate orders from Moscow) (Phillips, 1997). However his populist
appeal was based on his incorruptable image, rather than that of a
controversial firebrand figure like Zhirinovsky (Phillips, 1997; Hale,
2006:75). This was bult in part on his open criticism of the corruption
of superiors ("thieves") in the military and defence bureaucracy
(Simonsen, 1995:538). He also accused the political class of selling out
to the west -- unlike former corrupt statesmen who looted from imperial
territories and brought it back to Russia, "our contempporarys in the
other hand do their robberies at home and bring the loot abroad. Here
heads have to roll, mercilessly" (Simonsen, 1995:543). While this is
clearly evidence of OTH_POLCLASS rhetoric, this seems not to have
escalated beyond a 2 on our scale. His political platform was based on a
strong nationalist streak critical of the West's treatment of
post-soviet Russia (Simonsen, 1995:540), although his opposition to
OTH_FOREIGN did not reach the scale of Zhirinovski or Putin (2).

While Lebed seems like a supporter of democratic institutions, his
controversial praise for the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet
in Chile, and the fact that he defended the comment by praising Rissian
dictatorships from Peter the Great to Stalin, (Simonsen, 1995:542)
suggest that he was a mild threat to LIBDEMNORMS (2). His candidacy was
clearly centred no his personal saviour image (CHARISMA=3), and I have
not seen evidence of any significant OTH_IMMIGRANTS or OTH_ETHNIC
discourse. I have not seen evidence for any OTH_FINANCIAL populist
politics, although further research should confirm this. After serving
in Yeltsin's cabinet after the 1996 election (from which he was fired),
he served as governor of Krasnoyarsk Krai, and elected not to run for
president against Putin in 2000 despite expectations that he would. He
died in a plane crash in 2002

## Vladimir Putin / Unity / United Russia

Vladimir Putin's form of populism (and that of his Unity and United
Russia party) is tricky to explain. By some accounts he did not run as a
populist in his initial election in 2000, but introduced populist
rhetoric gradually in the mid-2000s (following the 'colour' revolutions
in the CIS and the Iraq War) and especially after the 2011-12 election
cycle (when Putin's economic narrative was hit by the 2008 econoomic
crisis) (Robinson 2017; Robinson and Milne 2017). Around the time of his
first re-election in 2004, he started to develop a "sovereign democracy"
rhetoric that defined Russian nationalism as distinct from the western
world, and Putin as the undisputed savoir preventing the return of
Yeltsen-era instability, incompetance and weakness (Casula 2013;
Robinson and Milne 2017:). When Putin returned to the presidency in
after a one-term hiatus 2012, this rhetoric of anti-western nationalism
in was ramped up and combined with a 'cultural turn' (anti-LGBT laws,
strengthened ties to the Orthodox Church, etc.) (Robinson 2017) that
have created what many consider to be an official 'strongman' populism
today.

There is a common argument that Putin's portrayal of the political elite
and the state bureaucracy constitutes what we would register as
OTH_POLCLASS populism. There is some evidence of this kind of populism:
Unity, for example, denied that it was even a party, saying instead that
it was merely an association of people fed up with seeing others decide
their fate (Eatwell, 2002:10). Likewise, UR has stated that it
represents merely "common sense" and that it "transcends ideological
myths" associated with other politicians and corrupt lethargy of
bureaucrats (Casula 2013:5, 7). These are all examples of distancing the
part and its leaders from other politicians. On the other hand, some
claim that Putin's origins as an insider run contrary to his portrayal
as a true populist. Lassila (2018) goes as far as arguing that Russia's
historical experience has produced a unique distrust in "the people" as
a political agent, and suggests instead that Putin be considered a
non-populist autocrat. At a minimum, it is not clear that Putin has
engaged in any explicit OTH_POLCLASS rhetoric, and hence for now this is
left at 1 throughout his tenure. This should be reviewed.

Putin has never envoked any OTH_FINANCIAL, OTH_IMMIGRANT, OTH_ETHNIC or
OTH_MILITARY populist rhetoric to registers on our variables. His most
important "other" is clearly OTH_FOREIGN, which I have labelled as 1
initially, escalating to 2 by the 2003-4 election period, and reaching 3
by the 2011-12 election period. Putin was obviously an INSIDER from the
beginning, just as Unity was created as a party of power. LIBDEMNORMS
are somewhat tricky given that these were never particularlystrnog t
begin with in Russia. However it seems fitting to label Putin/UR 2 from
his beginnings and escalate this to 3 by the 2011-12 period given its
increasingly authoritarian and autocratic nature. The most difficult of
all the variables here is CHARISMA. Unity was clearly built around the
ambitions of Putin and were dependent on his personality, and many have
argued that Putin has acted as the "empty signifier" of his and his
party's brand of populism (Casula 2013:7). However it is debatable that
Putin's populism was a personality-dependent form during his rise in
2000. An argument could be made that Putin was simply popular based on
his political skills and image as a relatively competent manager. I've
labelled the party 3 from its inception, but this should be reviewed.

## Rodina

Rodina ("motherland") was allegedly created by the Kremlin to syphon
votes from the Communist Party in 2003 (Varga, 2004; Hale 2006), but
soon showed an independent direction. Its original message was left wing
and nationalist (OTH_FINANCIAL=3), campaigning to reverse privatisations
from the 1990s and nationalise other assets. However it became better
known for its radical anti-immigrant advertising that included
suggestions that ethnic Russians needed to clean "garbage" from their
cities (Varga, 2008:570) (OTH_IMMIGRANT=3, OTH_ETHNIC=3). For this
reason it has been characterised mainly as a far right party even though
it had solid left credentials. This ideological position should be
investigated further. Authorities took the unprecedented step of banning
the party for this rhetoric in 2005. Little is written about the group
in English, so these codings need to be reviewed. The party merged
withseveral others to create the "Just Russia" Party, another more
consistently left-wing party with ties to the Kremlin. March (2009:518)
considers this party to alo be populist (against local bureaucrats but
not Putin), but more research should confirm this, for now it is not
included.
