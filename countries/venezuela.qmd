  After Venezuela's military dictatorship ended in 1958, two parties,
  COPEI and Acción Democrática, took turns running the county until the
  electoral victory of Hugo Chávez in 1998. Regarding the electoral system
  it is important to note that "until 1988 elections to the chamber of
  deputies ("Cámara de Diputados") and the senate ("Senado") took place on
  a single ballot ("tarjeta pequeña"). Therefore, the results were
  identical to those of the chamber of deputies. In 1993 and 1998 the
  elections to the chamber of deputies and the senate were held on
  separate ballots. In 1999 the senate was abolished." (Nohlen 2005, 575).

# Case notes

## Movement for Socialism/ MAS

Movement for Socialism ("Movimiento al Socialismo/MAS") is a very
difficult party to classify. It emerged in 1971 from a split from the
Communist party led by Teodoro Petkoff criticizing harshly its
verticality and authoritarianism and defending a deeper democratization
of both parties and institutions (Petkoff 1981, 1121-22). The party
still declared itself socialist and aimed for a socialist revolution of
society (Ellner 1988, 73), however, it rejected the idea of the economy
as a "superstructure" (Petkoff 1989b, 42), rejected the "established
Marxist dogma" and gave more importance to politics (Ellner 1988, 64).
It is here where its anti-elitism becomes evident. The party emerged
with a clear criticism of the "bipartidism" of the moment, the elites
("cogollos") and the bureaucratization of power (Petkoff 1989a, 105).
Its main proposal to renovate politics was to deepen the democratization
of parties and institutions, exemplified by institutionalizing in its
own party the existence of diverse tendencies (Petkoff 1981). Petkoff's
anti-elitism was very clear when he argued that "the transformation must
take place by breaking the power over society of those social and
political sectors that, in relation to the interests of the majority,
define options aimed at reinforcing minority privileges and optimizing
their economic benefits" (Petkoff 1989b, 41) (OTH_POLCLASS = 3).

Ideologically, the party was on the far left because it proposed public
ownership of the productive system and to control financial elites. The
party aimed at the combination of democratic freedoms and social justice
(Petkoff, 1989a) and also defended "workers' control, democratic
socialism, decentralization and municipal autonomy (Ellner 1988, 66).
They argued for a criticism of both capitalism and Stalitinst socialism
(Ellner 1988, 70). Petkoff, the party's leader stated that their
platform was based on "the revolutionary struggle against capitalism"
and that theirs was an alternative to both "existing socialism" and
"capitalism" (Petkoff 1989b, 40). Together with political parties, the
bourgeoisie was the other big elite group that was attacked. "They felt
that members of the Venezuelan bourgeoisie should be singled out for
special attack, as they constituted the main enemy in the upcoming
stage" (Ellner 1988, 73) (OTH_ECONOMIC = 3, LRPOSITION = FL).

MAS' foreign policy is, as Ellner describes it, a "vacillating and
subject to a mechanical and awkward policy of balancing criticism of the
United States with that of the Soviet Union." (Ellner 1988, 82). There
was also division within the party: "Marquez \[a prominent MAS leader\]
more strongly condemned U.S. foreign policy and was less critical of the
socialist bloc than was Petkoff. Nevertheless, MAS has consistently
favored third-world struggles for independence from super-power
domination and opposed all foreign intervention" (Ellner 1988, 80).
However, "Petkoff argued against the thesis that the anti-imperialist
struggle should be directed mainly against the United States because of
its greater hold over all facets of Venezuelan society. Petkoff and
other MASistas maintained that precisely because of the U.S. position of
dominance, Mas should display greater flexibility and establish ties
with influential North Americans in order to deter a possible U.S.
intervention against Venezuelan socialism" (Ellner 1988, 78). Thus, we
have labelled this mixed evidence as 2 on OTH_FOREIGN.

Regarding the military, MAS also broke with the traditional Marxist
critical view of the military. They viewed the military as a problematic
corpse, but one that had to be included into the normal social life of
Venezuela. As (Ellner 1988, 85) argues, "MAS's statements regarding the
moral integrity of the armed forces---though not as unqualified as those
of AD and COPEI---lend credence to the party's thesis regarding the need
to facilitate the integration of the armed forces in the nation's
political and administrative life". And "MAS called for specific
measures in order to facilitate the military's further integration into
society, some of which were undoubtedly viewed as detrimental and even
threatening by the military hierarchy" (Ellner 1988, 83). Thus, we have
coded 1 for OTH_MILITARY.

We have coded a 1 for LIBDEMNORMS due to its dedication to democratizing
parties and institutions (Petkoff, 1989a). Petkoff was the party's
presidential candidate in 1983 and 1988 but the party supported Rafel
Caldera in 1993 and Hugo Chávez in 1998 and 2000. Petkoff had no role in
government previously (INSIDER = 1) and although he was one of the
leaders of the party, the party emerged out of a political split with
the Communist Party and did not depend on one candidate (Ellner 1988,
38) (CHARISMA = 1). In recognition of their support, President Rafael
Caldera named Petkoff as Minister of Health which means they by the 1998
elections they are coded as (INSIDER = 3, INC_PARL = 2).

## Fifth Republic Movements/ United Socialist Party of Venezuela 

Populism in Venezuela is mostly linked to Hugo Chávez's "Bolivarian
Revolution". There are significant differences in the tone,
aggressiveness and rhetoric of Chávez before and after winning the 1998
elections, although he defended a similar ideology based on
revolutionizing Venezuelan politics, opposing the decadent political
regime and combatting neoliberal policies. In a couple of interviews
before the election, he assured he would not nationalize any media
company, he welcomed foreign investment (Ramos 1998) and he argued in
favour of private ownership of certain industries (tourism, lottery,
banking) (Bayly 1998). According to Scocozza y Colucciello (2016, 29),
the real increase in aggressiveness came after winning the election as a
way of marking a breaking point with the previous political
establishment particularly after the failed 2002 coup d'état against
him. Maduro's presidency has seen a general deterioration of the
political situation in Venezuela, an exacerbation of Chávez's rhetoric
and an intensification of political repression.

We have also included in the dataset the parties Fatherland for all
("Patria para todos") and For Social Democracy ("Por la Democracia
Social /Podemos") because they are satellite parties of Chávez in the
2005 legislative election which simply did not wish to become part of
his vertical party structure. However, given that they support Chavismo
we have followed the same coding as the one we used for the 2005
elections for Chávez's party.

Chávez's initial political rhetoric in 1998 focused on the idea of
revolution, on a symbolic and mythic connection with the heroes of the
Venezuelan past, particularly of Simón Bolívar, on constant messages to
his Christian values and on the call for a "proceso constituyente"
(López Maya 2008), that is, for the creation of a new constitution that
would give power to the people.

Chávez argued forcefully for the creation of a new political era. This
was explicitly mentioned in his address to the Congress when debating
the new constitution and in his rejection of the previous political
system by saying that the "IV Republic was born with the applause of the
conservative oligarchy" (Scocozza y Colucciello 2016, 33). Moreover,
Roberts (2012: 145) argues that "Chávez defined the enemy primarily in
terms of the political establishment against which he had launched his
ill-fated coup attempt in 1992. In particular, he condemned the leaders
of AD and COPEI as a corrupt, entrenched, and self-serving political
elite that made a farce of representative democracy" Roberts (2012: 145)
(OTH_POLCLASS = 3).

However, his classification in left-right axis and against the financial
elite is less clear in the 1998 and 2000 election campaigns. Slogans
such as "homeland, socialism or death" or "Socialism of the XXI century"
did not gain relevance until after the failed coup (Scocozza y
Colucciello 2016, 30). In his first electoral campaign, Chávez was
considerably more moderate and gained his inspiration more from
nationalism than socialism (Bolívar 2001, 47; Roberts 2012, 145). While,
on one side, Ellner (2004, 11) and (Gates (2010, 3) argue that Chávez
was a "staunchly anti-neoliberal" candidate in 1998 and Molina (2002,
231) points out that he based his 2000 campaign on "claims on social
division between rich and poor, presenting himself as a friend of the
poor and an enemy of the oligarchs", on the other side, Roberts, drawing
on Blanco Muñoz (1998, 611-14), defends that

> "Chavismo could define itself in opposition to international capital
> and globalized neoliberalism, without rejecting capitalism or
> capitalists per se. Indeed, Chávez came to power advocating a
> 'humanistic' mixed economy that borrowed from both capitalist and
> socialist development models, with a market freed from monopoly
> control and a developmentalist state committed to nurturing national
> producers, both public and private" (Roberts, 2012: 146).

In fact, he even rejected the label of "socialist" in favor of
"Bolivarian" before the 1998 elections (Bayly, 1998). Nevertheless, by
the standards of our dataset it is still possible to code MVR as
far-left and opposed to the financial elite (LRPOSITION = FL,
OTH_ECONOMIC = 3). From 2004 socialism really became the centre of
Chávez's political discourse with the creation of the "New strategic map
of the Bolivarian Revolution" (Colmenares, 2011: 11). In the 2012
election campaign, this was evident when he attacked his political
opponent as a "lackey of imperialism" and a "lackey of the bourgeoisie"
(Scocozza y Colucciello 2016, 33).

Immigration to Venezuela is rarely mentioned in Chavez's discourses or
in academic texts on his politics. In fact, he carried on mass
nationalizations of immigrants in 2003 under the project "Misión
Identidad" (López Maya 2008) (OTH_IMMIGRANT = 1). Being a soldier
himself and having created a movement inside the military that preceded
his political party ("Movimiento Bolivariano Revolucionario 200"
(MBR-200)), Chávez did not associate the military with the elite, in
fact, the military was seen as a possible agent of revolutionary change
(Colmenares, 2011: 9). In the 2012 election Chávez explicitly praised
the military for "being committed, as the working class, with the
Bolivarian Constitution" (Scocozza y Colucciello 2016, 33) (OTH_MILITARY
= 1).

Chávez positioned nationalism and retrieving popular sovereignty as the
central axis of his 1998 campaign. He started his inaugural speech with
a reference to the "father of the homeland", Simón Bolívar, that summed
up his nationalist discourse: "Blessed is the citizen who, under the
coat of arms of his command, summons national sovereignty to exercise
his absolute will" (Chávez, 1999). In this sense Chávez\'s nationalism
was "inclusionary" of groups that previously felt excluded such as
working class or indigenous citizens and not based on the exclusion of
ethnic "aliens" such as European right-wing populism (Mudde y Kaltwasser
2013). In fact, Chávez stressed constantly his commitment to
Americanismo and to Bolívar's notion of Gran Patria, that is, the vision
of a common interest and identity to all Latin American countries
(Colmenares, 2011: 9). Chávez repeated constantly his commitment to the
improvement of the indigenous communities, however, he did not identify
with one particular ethnic group. The 1999 constitution declared
Venezuela to be "multiethnic and pluricultural" (Constitution of
Venezuela 1999). Moreover, he did not make this the main axis of his
politics, but instead understood the fight for indigenous people as one
aspect of the larger struggle between the people and the elite. Taking
this into consideration, we have coded him 1 for OTH_ETHNIC.

Roberts (2012: 145) has argued that "while Chávez had always been
critical of U.S. imperialism and its ties to elite interests in
Venezuelan society, he intensified his critique in response to
Washington's thinly veiled support for the military coup that briefly
removed him from office in April 2002". Moreover, in an interview with
Bayly (1998), Chávez stresses the desire of collaboration with the IMF
and other international institutions. Attending to this criterion, we
have coded 2 for OTH_FOREIGN in the 1998 and 2000 elections and a 3
since the 2006 election.

Chávez was a well-known character in Venezuelan politics before his
election in 1998, particularly after his failed coup in 1992. However,
he did not hold any office before becoming president. Thus, he is coded
as a 1 in INSIDER in 1998 and a 3 in the rest of elections.

There is much debate over the characterization of Venezuela as a
democracy or as a dictatorship. Freedom House (2017) considers the
country "Partly Free" until 2017, where it becomes "Not Free" and Polity
IV (2014) considers it an open anocracy since 2007. Chávez took over the
years a series of measures that threatened political pluralism and
freedom of the press. He dissolved the opposition-controlled Congress in
favor of a Chávez-leaning Constituent Assembly, he extended the powers
of the president by weakening checks and balances against the executive
branch, the new constitution made no mention to political parties, he
replaced many military officials and oil company managers with men close
to him, he changed the electoral system to favor his political party and
took control over some media companies (Colmenares G. 2011, 33; Roberts
2012). In 2006, the opposition decided not to participate in the
elections as a protest against their "undemocratic nature". However,
formally, Venezuela continued to be a democracy and Chávez passed these
reforms in several referenda. Although there is a significant difference
between measures taken by Chávez and measures taken under Maduro's
government, such as the imprisonment of political opponents like
Leopoldo López or Antonio Ledezma, overall, actions taken by both
governments can be considered as a radical break with previous liberal
democracy norms (LIBDEMNORMS = 3).

There is a clear cult around Hugo Chávez in his movement and he
identified directly with the people. He argued repeatedly that "Chávez
is not just a man, but that Chávez is a people" (Michelutti 2017).
Nevertheless, the political system before his victory in 1998 showed
clear signs of decomposition and all candidates in that election where
anti-establishment (Molina, 2002). After Chávez's death, there was
plenty debate over if Chavismo would survive under Maduro's leadership,
which it has done. However, Maduro draws his support from Chávez's
charisma, and it is perfectly imaginable that another politician could
have taken its place. We have coded the Chávez's parties 3 on CHARISMA,
and the United Socialist Party of Venezuela 2 under Maduro.

In 2019 the country suffered a deep institutional crisis when the
opposition parties to Chavismo questioned the results of the 2018
presidential elections and named Juan Guaidó as interim president. The
opposition parties also boycotted the 2020 legislative elections which
resulted in very low participation levels and a huge victory for the
United Socialist Party of Venezuela. Results of the 2018 and 2020
elections should be taken with a grain of salt as well as the rest of
elections since the promulgation of the new constitution, which have
been subject to enormous criticism due to their lack of democratic
standards.

## Radical Cause and others

Radical Cause ("Causa Я") is a clear antecedent to Chávez. It was the
main party of the opposition to Caldera in the 1993 election and
Lalander (2008, 40) that it was "the party closest to Chávez and that a
great number of their militants, union leaders and MPs would later be
part of 'Chavismo'". Thus, we have coded them in a similar fashion as
MVR for the 1993 election and again in the 2000 election in which it was
the main party of the opposition in the presidential election. The 2000
election shows the relevance of the populist discourse of Chávez because
the candidate of Radical Cause was one of the colleagues of Chávez in
the 1992 failed coup d'état.
