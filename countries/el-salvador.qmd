## FMLN

El Salvador suffered a Civil War from 1980 until 1992. The war started
when El Salvador was controlled by a military-led Junta and confronted
the Government against the FMLN. During the Civil War, the FMLN was an
umbrella organization that coordinated, at least, 5 left-wing guerrilla
groups. El Salvador approved a new constitution in 1983, held its first
truly democratic elections in 1984 and reached a peace agreement with
the FMLN in 1992. The Chapultepec Peace Accords included the
demobilization of armed forces and the legalization of the FMLN as a
political party. Since the 1994 presidential elections, the FMLN has
become the main left-wing party of the country.

The inclusion of a Marxist guerrilla in a classification of populist
parties is bound to be contested by those who see populist and communist
political discourses as categorically different. However, there are many
elements in common. The FMLN makes a clear distinction between the
masses and the elite in the form of an oppressive state and, after 12
years of Civil War, considers the "other" as enemies rather than as
political adversaries. Nonetheless, the FMLN accepted the democratic
route to gain power (Zamora, 1998: 227). Sprenkels (2018) argues that
the party went through an "ambivalent moderation" in which the party was
recurrently in internal conflict between the different factions within
it. It should be noted that the FMLN is far from an ideologically
unified party and it has had numerous internal struggles.

Allison and Martin (2012) explain that the party has been torn apart by
two main tendencies: one the one side the "orthodox" or "revolutionary
socialists", which saw peace as the next step towards achieving the
revolution and were more ideologically radical and on the other side the
"moderates" or "renovators" which argued that the peace was the
revolution and which moderated their discourse. In the internal clashes
between these broad tendencies, the hard-liners managed to hold control
of the organization most of the time and this led to up to three splits
from the moderate faction and the creation of new parties. However,
since all of these new parties failed to achieve significant electoral
support and the FMLN increased its share of votes election after
election, the main position of the FMLN lied with the "orthodox". After
the first split in 1994 election, for example, the remining
organizations in the FMLN "reaffirmed their identities as Marxist
revolutionary organizations and their intent on constructing socialism"
(Allison and Martin, 2012: 99). Moreover, the FMLN document outlining
its principles displays a commitment to "serve the interests of the
majority" and a strong patriotism (FMLN, 2011). Therefore, I labelled 3
in Political class and Financial Elite and FL as the ideology of the
party.

Sprenkels (2018: 15) states that "in government, the FMLN has done
little to enhance institutional checks and balances". It even tried to
undermine the country's Supreme Court's independence (Réserve, 2016:
192). Additionally, Mauricio Funes fled the country because he was being
investigated for corruption. Moreover, the victory of the orthodox
faction in the 2000s led to a reinstating of the Leninist understanding
of the party and to the suppression of the internal democratic elections
to choose candidates (Acevedo Moreno, 2006). Furthermore, clientelism
was a practice well extended within the party (Sprenkels, 2018: 15). I
believe these elements deserve a 3 in violation of LD norms.

On Foreign Policy Interests, the party held a "vocal opposition to the
country's dollarization and participation in any free trade agreement
with the US" (Sprenkels, 2018: 13) and displayed a continuous
anti-imperialistic sentiment (Sprenkels, 2018: 17). However, Mauricio
Funes has taken a different direction and has strengthened commercial
and political relations with the US despite disagreement from the FMLN
leadership (Allison and Martín, 2012: 112). I have coded 3 for Foreign
Policy since 1994 with the exception of the period of Mauricio Funes
where I have coded 2 in order to show this more moderate -but not fully
welcoming- position regarding the US.

After 12 years of Civil War, the demilitarization of the country was
seen as essential to achieve peace and it was one of the main objectives
of the FMLN (Zamora, 2017). According to the FMLN, the military
participated and perpetuated crimes during the war and formed part of
the state's repression. However, the main enemies were the paramilitary
death squadrons and the demilitarization was effectuated according to
the Peace Accord. Therefore, I have coded 2 for military because it is
possible to distinguish between the military and the political elite and
the former received most of the criticism.

None of the presidential candidates belonged to the inner circle of
decision making of the previous government with the exception of
Salvador Sánchez Cerén, who was Funes' vice-president and Hugo Martínez,
who was Sánchez Cerén's Minister of Foreign Affairs. The FMLN is based
on an endogenous ideology and is not based on the personality of any
leader. In fact, according to Allison and Martín (2012) the FMLN owed
part of its defeats to the selection of unpopular presidential
candidates within the pool of former guerrilla leaders. Mauricio Funes
represented a departure in this tendency and run on a platform supported
not only by the FMLN but by an organization called "Friends of Funes"
completely based on his personal figure. Therefore, I have coded all
elections 1 in Inner Populism until 2012 and 3 in the remaining
elections. I labelled all elections 1 for Personality Dependent except
for 2009. Immigration and ethnic others are not depicted as enemies or
threats for the FMLN.

## Nayib Bukele

Nayib Bukele became president of El Salvador in 2019. He is a former
businessman from Palestinian origins that belonged to the FMLN. With
this party, he became the mayor of the capital, but he did not take part
in the national government of the FMLN (1 in Insider Populism). He
created a new party in 2017 and was expelled from the FMLN. The new
party, however, was forbidden by the courts to run in the 2019 elections
because the inscription period had already pass. Bukele decided, then,
to be the presidential candidate of GANA, a right-wing party. It is
still unsure how much influence will this party have in his government
but Bukele argues that it used that party only as a necessary means to
an end (ABC, 2019) and openly disagrees with some of its ideas. It is
difficult to pin down Bukele's ideology. Some argue that he is a
"classic populist" for which the categories of left and right are not
useful any more (BBC, 2019). However, given its emphasis in the
country's poor in his discourses, his previous membership of the FMLN
and his self-definition as progressive, I have coded Left as his
ideology. Moreover, the fact that Nayib Bukele presented itself as the
candidate of a party with a different ideology, based the campaign
solely in his figure and still won the election in the first round,
shows the extreme importance of the personality of the presidential
candidate. I labelled 3 in Personality Dependent.

The main axis of Bukele's campaign consists in presenting himself as an
outsider that will fight the corruption of the two ruling parties (ABC,
2019). He argues that the inefficient and corrupt management of the
previous governments is responsible for El Salvador's deplorable
economic and social situation. He defended that "this battle is for
every person from El Salvador that has been ignored by their
governments" (Bukele, 2019a) and used short mottos such as "they should
return what they stole" or "there is enough money when nobody steals it"
to depict the previous governments as corrupt. Thus, I have coded 3 for
"Political Class".

As a businessman himself, Bukele aims at creating a productive economy
for El Salvador that will improve the conditions of the country. He did
not display animosity against the financial elite but defined the elite
in primarily political terms. Therefore, I believe 1 in Financial Elite
accurately reflects his position.

On Foreign Interests, Bukele has repeated constantly his desire to
"re-establish, improve and increase relations with the US" (Bukele,
2019b). Bukele has not displayed any antagonism against any other
country but has harshly criticized Maduro's (Venezuela) and Ortega's
(Nicaragua) governments for using force to remain in power (BBC, 2019),
which contrasts with the position taken by Sánchez Cerén. Being himself
of migrant origins Bukele made no negative mention of incoming migrants
or ethnic groups. Lastly, Bukele has not taken any action against LD
norms.
