## Álvaro Uribe

Colombia has traditionally been conceived as an unfertile country for
the emergence of populist forces (Dugas, 2003; Giraldo, 2018). Although
Jorge Eliécer Gaitán and Gustavo Rojas Pinilla are considered examples
of populism there is much debate on whether Álvaro Uribe Vélez, the most
influential politician of the XXI Century in Colombia, can be classified
as a populist or not. Uribe did not emphasize the opposition with the
financial elites, was not particularly charismatic and rejected
explicitly populism (Dugas, 2002: 1126). Uribe also defended orthodox
and neoliberal policies because one of his main "three pillars",
"investment trust" was to make Colombia a secure and attractive place
for foreign investment (Uribe, 2002). Moreover, Uribe was particularly
known for his hard stance on security issues. The first of his three
pillars was the "democratic security" which involved hardline policies
regarding left-wing guerrillas such as the FARC.

However, none of these are sufficient reasons not to classify Uribe as a
populist. Uribe had been a member of the Liberal Party but ran as an
independent in the 2002 election under a platform called "Colombia
First". He strongly criticized the political system at the time, saying
in his 100 points manifesto (2002: point 4) that "I dream with a state
that serves the people and not corruption and politicking"
("politiquería"). This last term is a derogatory way to refer to
politics and it is very present in Uribe's campaign, so much that one of
his promises was to announce a "Referendum against Corruption and
Politicking" as his very first action in government (Uribe, 2002: point
9). In that same manifesto, he also criticized pluralism by stating that
"pluralism had been transformed into dispersion and anarchy due to the
salaries, the clientelism and the pension privileges" (Uribe, 2002:
point 22). Furthermore, he made constant references to the fatherland
and aimed to achieve national unity in the fight against the guerrillas.
Uribe clearly delimitated an "us" vs "them" based on support to his
security policies. He divided society between "the patriots that support
the policy of Democratic Security and the Communists in disguise that
wish to sell the fatherland to the FARC" (Fierro, 2012: 130). He
conceded no legitimacy to the guerrillas and attacked those who did as
traitors. The only legitimate policy was to defeat the armed groups in
order to achieve a country "without guerrillas, without
paramilitaries... without drugs" (Uribe 2002: points 26 and 31). Some of
the policies involved "praising the profession of soldier and policemen"
(Uribe 2002: point 28) as well as paying regular citizens that had
undertaken anti-terrorist actions (Uribe 2002: point 39).

His manifesto clearly states the protection of minority rights and
immigration is not a relevant element in his platform. As a former
governor of one of Colombia's regions and mayor to one of its most
important cities, Uribe was included in previous political settlements
but was a peripheral figure in them. Although he created the new party
and undertook a very personalistic style, the decay of the previous
political system was evident and anti-corruption was a common platform
among several parties in the 2002 election (Duges, 2003: 1126). Uribe
declared a state-of-siege shortly after becoming president which was
condemned by human rights organizations (El País, 2002), has attacked
the press (Fierro, 2014: 139) and has been repeatedly accused of
collaboration with far-right paramilitary groups (El País, 2006).

However, the state-of-siege measure is quite common in Colombian history
and he accepted the Constitutional Court's decisions when they did not
rule in his favor (Dugas, 2003: 1133). Therefore, I have classified him
as 1 in Immigration and Ethnic Others and as 2 in Personality Dependent,
Insider Populism and Violation of LD norms.

It is certainly difficult to classify Uribe into one category but there
are enough elements in a world comparison, to include him in the
database at this stage of the project.

Álvaro Uribe ended his presidency with one of the highest approval rates
in Colombian history and his personality has profoundly marked politics
after him. When he failed to pass a law that could allow him to run for
a third time, Juan Manuel Santos was regarded as his successor. Santos
had been Uribe's Defense Minister and, although he ran a campaign that
was also tough on the FARC, his profile was that of a rich technocrat
that ran on a platform of continuity with Uribe's politics. He argued
that he was the opposite to populism and shortly after his victory he
changed his discourse regarding the guerrillas. He initiated the "peace
dialogues" with the FARC and that made Uribe distance from him. The most
important expression of this conflict was the 2016 referendum on the
Peace Agreement.

Santos' main rival in 2014 and its successor in the presidency in 2018
have both been successors of Uribe under the umbrella of the Democratic
Centre, the party that Uribe founded in 2013 to confront Santos. The CD
is a party regarded my many as right-wing although they explicitly
situate themselves in the center. Uribe's ideas have remained fairly
constant throughout the past 20 years and the CD shares his programmatic
points view, merely adding two more to Uribe's three pillars (CD
website). I have coded this party in the same manner as the rest of
Uribe's government in all legislative elections.

However, the inclusion of the two presidential candidates of the
Uribismo as populist is less clear. They both owe their popularity to
being related to Uribe, they did not try to distance themselves from him
and their discourses are less anti-elitists, more plural and more
moderate than that of the leader of the CD. These politicians agree with
Uribe on the substantive elements of his discourse but employ to a much
lesser degree his populist strategies. Francisco Panizza (in private
conversation) argued against including them in any populism dataset and
Jorge Giraldo uses the label populist just to refer to the figure of
Álvaro Uribe (Giraldo, 2019). I, too, agree that neither Óscar Zuluaga
nor Iván Duque should be included. However, in case the team decides to
include them, I have tried to find similarities in their discourse that
may justify their inclusion.

In the 2014 presidential election, Óscar Iván Zuluaga's motto was "on
the side of the Colombians". In a TV ad, Uribe reads a text in which
defends Zuluaga's candidacy in order "to vote against the
Castro-Chavismo that some wish to bring to Colombia and that the
government allows" (Zuluaga, 2014a). The election was dominated by the
topic of the "peace process" in which Zuluaga (2018b) claimed he would
stop the dialogues if he were to become president of Colombia. Zuluaga
had been Minister of Finance with Uribe and did not make any claim
against immigrants or ethnic minorities.

Iván Duque is difficult to classify as well. Constant references to the
fatherland and Colombia and a clear opposition to the peace agreements
situate him as a follower of Uribe´s politics. In his inaugural address
he stated clearly his vision of popular unity when stating: "Let's not
let anything distract us from the path of union. No more divisions of
left and right: we are Colombia; no more false divisions between
neoliberals and socialists: we are Colombia; no more divisions between
tendencies: we are Colombia" (Duque, 2018). Moreover, Duque tried to
establish a direct connection with the people by stating over and over
in one of his political adds "I am like you, proud of my country and
willing to do anything for it" (Duque, 2018b). Duque was an unknown
politician in 2018 which only had 4 years of experience as a senator.
Previous to that he worked at international organizations in technical
positions. His success depends mainly from being Álvaro Uribe´s chosen
candidate. On immigration, Duque proposed the creation of a
"humanitarian fund" for migrants from Venezuela that have fled the
country (Tomaselli, 2018). Although Duque is included in the database
for its belonging to the CD, its ties with Uribe and some aspects of his
discourse, it should be noted that he displays a more moderated and
plural understanding of politics than other members of his party
(Tomaselli, 2018).

## M-19

The party "Alternative Democracy M-19", came out of a peace process
between the government of Colombia and several left-wing guerrillas such
as M-19. As part of these peace accords, a new constitution was drafted
in 1991 and the guerrillas were included in the political process. The
main ideology of the party was Marxist (Boudon, 2001: 75) but the party
aimed at reaching a larger section of the electorate by presenting
themselves as "the new political alternative" and "more than a party"
(Villamizar, 1995: 571). The central issue for the party, however, was
not communism, but democracy (Boudon, 2001: 76). Carlos Pizarro, leader
of the M-19 until his assassination, employed populist tropes when he
argued that "what we need to do is create something that attracts the
nonconformists within the traditional parties, the nonconformists within
the private enterprise, the nonconformists within the guerrilla ranks,
the nonconformists within society in general... and which it is capable
of offering proposals to the nation" (quoted in Beccassino, 1989: 110).
The M-19 also heavily criticized Liberal President Gaviria's neoliberal
reforms and the hardline it took with the existing active guerrilla
groups (Boudon, 2001: 81).

Their platform was based on 8 points: "(1) peace and an end to violence,
(2) rejection of corruption and clientelism, (3) constitutional
development toward a "social state of law", (4) an economic policy based
on production and an expanding socioeconomic base, (5) a specific
employment program, (6) a pact to protect the environment, (7) priority
for social programs, and (8) Latin American regional integration" (El
Nuevo Siglo, 1993). Moreover, the party emphasized the need to end
military impunity (Boudon, 2001: 89). They do not mention immigration or
ethnic others as threats and the party did not take any action against
the prevailing LD norms. Navarro Wolf, the presidential candidate, did
briefly participate in Pastrana's government as Health Minister but this
was seen more as a political concession in the context of the peace
process. Navarro Wolf belonged to the inner circle of decision making.
Therefore, I have coded FL for ideology, 3 for Political Class,
Financial Elite, Military and Foreign Interests and 1 for every other
category.

## Gustavo Petro

The 2018 elections saw the emergence of a left-wing populist candidate,
Gustavo Petro. Petro was part of the M-19 guerrilla and later of the
party of the same name. When the party disbanded, he became part of the
left-wing party "Polo Democrático" achieving the ranks of MP, Senator
and presidential candidate in 2010. Petro later founded his own party,
"Movimiento Progesista" and became mayor of Bogotá. He then run for
president of Colombia in 2018 under the platform "Humane Colombia"
("Colombia Humana"). Since he never took part in any national government
or belonged to any of the most popular parties, I have labelled 1 for
Insider Populism. Gustavo Petro created the new party and the
presidential coalition and ran on a populist platform based on his
personal figure. None of these may have existed without the candidate
himself although probably a left-wing variety of populism would have
emerged in its place. Therefore, I have coded 2 for Personality
Dependent.

In a TV advertisement, Petro clearly outlined his populist discourse:
"The first time that a presidential candidate that does not represent
the "politiquería", not the power of the elites, nor the corrupts who
have sacked the country and are now surrounding Duque, may win the
elections" and "it is the first time that a government may be formed
that really works for the people" (Petro, 2018a).

Corruption is the main topic of his discourse and he relates all of
Colombia's problems to it. For example, he states that "the problem with
the healthcare system is not that we need more money, but corruption"
(Petro, 2018b). He also dilutes its ideological position when he defends
that "I was leftist and I do not regret it but my proposal is not
socialist, that did not work, we propose the development of a democratic
capitalism based on granting access to a rural middle class to
productive lands" (Petro, 2018b). However, Petro is very critic with the
huge inequalities of the country and aims to distribute wealth
extensively. I believe the best way to code Petro is with Left for
Ideology, 3 for Political Class and 2 for Financial Elite.

Petro's opinion on the army was dominated by a comment he made in the
campaign in which he said that "those youngsters that cannot study in
university may end ... in the drug cartels or trying to find a job in
the police or the army" (Petro, 2018c). Petro (2018d) rejected the
notion that he hated the military and defended himself by saying that he
gave shelter to the army while mayor of Bogotá. I have decided to follow
Petro's own self-description and label him as 1 in military.

I have found no significant action in violation of LD norms. In the
campaign, Petro criticized that the Colombian foreign policy was
subordinated to that of the US due to the money this country provides to
Colombia to fight drug cartels (Petro, 2018e). He also argued for
Colombia to occupy a more prominent and less subordinate role in
international politics. During the crisis in Venezuela, Petro called for
rallies against any military intervention in Venezuela by the US (Petro,
2019). Although Petro is clearly critic of foreign power interests,
these are not constructed as the main threat to the country. I have
labelled 2 in Foreign Interests.
