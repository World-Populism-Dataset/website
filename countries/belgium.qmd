## Flemish Bloc/ Flemish Interest 

The Flemish Blok (*Vlaams Blok*, VB) started in the late 1970s as a
coalition of small parties who had splintered from the conserve People's
Union. For almost a decade it made no sizeable impact on Belgian
politics until its first breakout success in the 1991 elections. Around
this time it established itself as a radical right wing party
representing the Flemish community in Belgium. After being sued by the
official anti-racism body in Belgium, it changed its name to the Flemish
Interest (*Vlaams Belang*) while retaining its organisation and ideology
(Jagers and Walgrave 2007, 320). After declining consistently since
2007, it made a strong comeback in the 2019 election.

According to de Lange and Akkerman (de Lange and Akkerman 2012, 31) the
party's ideology is built on an opposition to three groups supposedly
hostile to the interests of the Flemish people: immigrants, people from
Wallonia (French speaking Belgians), and the political elites from
across the country. In 1992 the party published a seventy-point
programme which, among other things, demanded that immigrants be
returned to their country of origin (Pauwels 2013, 89; de Lange and
Akkerman 2012, 28). It has repeated other forms of nativist rhetoric,
such as its slogan "own people first" (Coffé, Heyndels, and Vermeir
2007, 143), and the repeated assertion that Muslim and Eastern European
immigrants are involved in crimes at an "alarming" rate (Coffé 2005, 77)
(OTH_IMMIGRANT, OTH_ETHNIC= 3). It has branded all other parties as,
among other insults, a "political mafia", and alleged that it is
supported by a cultural elite in high society (Pauwels 2013, 90; de
Lange and Akkerman 2012, 32; De Cleen 2016, 76) (OTH_POLCLASS = 3).
Aside from these points, the party also favours harsh law and order
policies and socially conservative policies aimed at encouraging women
to have more children and outlawing abortion (Billiet and Witte 1995,
186). According to Pauwels (Pauwels 2013, 90) "economic issues are less
important" to the party, and other than a general welfare Chauvanism,
its position on economic policy is generally unclear. For this reason we
have coded it FR on LRPOSITION and 1 on OTH_ECONOMIC. While the party is
generally considered to be Eurosceptic, we have not seen evidence that
this stance is important enough to register on the OTH_FOREIGN variable
(= 1).

Many scholars and commentators have alleged that the party is a threat
to democracy in Belgium (Meijen, Raube, and Wouters 2023). Evidence for
this lies in its wish to radically reform and centralise the Belgian
state (abolishing provinces), develop a system of majoritarian referenda
to decide policy, and its repeated attacks on media criticism (it calls
such criticism a "witch hunt", and has a history of bringing legal
action against critical journalists (de Lange and Akkerman 2012,
33--35)). There is clearly a lot behind this assessment, but given that
the party does not condone violence, nor question the ley of elections
(as far as we've seen) we have coded it 1 on LIBDEMNORMS. According to
some (de Lange and Akkerman 2012, 32; Pauwels 2013, 94) the party is not
dominated by its leader. However the central position of Filip Dewinter
in party for many years has led some to allege that is somewhat
leader-centric. We have coded it 1 on CHARISMA, but this should be
confirmed. As we have seen no evidence that the leaders of the party
served in government, we have coded the party 1 on INSIDER.

## Not included

New Flemish Alliance (*Nieuw-Vlaamse Alliantie*, N-VA) is a more
moderate Flemish nationalist party compared with the VB, and has
arguably done well by attracting VB voters who think that the cordon
sanitaire against the party makes voting for it superfluous (Pauwels and
Haute 2017, 2). N-VA has been a challenge for populist scholars: while
it has often used anti-establishment and ethno-nationalist rhetoric
(Pauwels 2013, 86), it is not an anti-system party like VB, and each of
the variables most associated with right wing populism (OTH_POLCLASS,
OTH_IMMIGRANTS, and OTH_ETHNIC) are notably softer in the N-VAs rhetoric
than a typical populist party by our definition. Leader Bart De Wever
has sought to clearly distinguish the party from VB's nativism: "We
strive for an inclusive citizenship that is acquirable for everyone,
even for foreigners. That is inconceivable for the VB" (Maly 2016, 271).
For these reasons, several populist scholars have studied the party but
concluded that it should not be called populist (Pauwels 2013; Van
Kessel 2015, 37). There are two other populist parties of note since
1980 that have not past the 5% threshold. List Dedecker is a
charisma-based neo-liberal populist party but only peaked at 4% in 2007.
The Wallonian Front National, seen as a kind of French-speaking
equivalent to the VB, has also performed poorly.
