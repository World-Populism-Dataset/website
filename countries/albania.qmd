## Edi Rama, Socialist Party of Albania

The only Albanian populist figure who reaches the 5% threshold since the
return to multiparty parliamentary elections in 1992 is the Socialist
Party of Albania (PS) leader Edi Rama. Rama is a former artist and
basketball player who served as Mayor of Tirana between 2000 and 2011
and who took over the leadership of the PS in 2006 -- the first leader
of the party not to have been a member of the Albanian Communist Party
(Kajsiu 2016, 289). Rama's ascent to power took place among massive
protests in 2011 following corruption allegations within the previous
coalition government (Kajsiu 2014, 112). He was elected Prime Minster
with a minority government in 2013 and re-elected with an outright
majority in 2017.

According to several sources, in the years before his first national
election in 2013, as Mayor Rama mastered a kind of "anti-politics"
rhetoric that lent heavily on populist conceptions of ordinary people
being held back by the elite (Kajsiu 2010, 245; Budini 2012). He was
part of a group who, after the transition from communism, "came to
define themselves against political parties and politicians" as part of
an "anti-political project" (Budini 2012), which, in combination with
his artist background and personalistic style, has led him to be
classified by Budini as Albania's "pop(ulist) star" (Budini 2008). In
Kajsiu's words:

> Edi Rama, trans­formed the antipolitics discourse from an attack on
> politics in general into an attack against the "old politics" in the
> name of a new one. According to him the old politics of the past had
> caused much damage to Albania and Albanians, it had "poisoned the
> blood of Albanian society, it \[had\] halted her and her development."
> (Kajsiu 2010, 245)

While some of this language is boilerplate in post-communist Albania,
Rama seems to have taken it to a new level. He ran on an anti-corruption
platform which targeted the entire state and political elite, claiming
that corruption was "endemic in every cell of the state organism and in
every contact of the state with the extended hand of the citizen that is
asking for a service" (Kajsiu 2021, 40). Rama accused one incumbent,
Ilir Meta of the Socialist Movement for Integration (SMI) of
representing "everything that is rotten in Albanian Politics" (though he
subsequently joined a coalition with him for the 2013 elections) (Kajsiu
2014, 113). He also called the incumbent government of Berisha Sali a
"regime of thievery and extortionists", and a "morally fallen power,
rotten to its core" (Heba 2017, 11). In contrast to the political status
quo, he has styled himself as a "political outsider" (Lela 2016, 44),
declaring in 2009 "I am not a politician! I want to say this out loud. I
am a citizen, like you, like many others" (Kajsiu 2010, 246). He has
governed in a personalist way -- for example having his supporters
directly submit the names of corrupt officials whom he subsequently
black listed, and campaigning in 2017 on a platform of "co-governance
with common people" (André 2017). There is a dearth of English language
sources on Rama's rhetoric after becoming Prime Minister -- however,
owing to what has been written earlier we have coded him 3 on
OTH_POLCLASS.

He has attacked critical media with significant vitriol (André 2017),
but we do not think that this escalates to a 2 on the LIBDEMNORMS
variable (= 1). We found no evidence for any rhetoric on the
OTH_IMMIGRANTS, OTH_MILITARY, OTH_ECONOMIC or OTH_ETHNIC variables (each
= 1). Rama has engaged in some nationalistic rhetoric against Albania's
neighbours (see Rrustemi 2020), but not to the point of identifying
their hand in the people's grievances (OTH_FOREIGN = 1).

According to most sources Rama is notably "charismatic" (Fras 2017;
Triantis, n.d.), and his campaigns have turned the PS into a "one-man
show" (Kalemaj 2020, 32). However, given the existing strength of the
party before his rise we've coded it 2 on CHARISMA. Despite the fact
that Rama has advocated for the irredentist cause of "Greater Albania"
including ethnic Albanian Kosovo and parts of North Macedonia, and has
been called a "nationalist" (Rrustemi 2020, 19, 25), he clearly belongs
to the centre left tradition in Albanian politics (LRPOSITION = CL).
Owing to his non-political past we've coded him 1 on INSIDER up to 2013
and 3 after he became Prime Minister in 2013.
