  Thailand has had a patchy history of democratization, with numerous
  democratic constitutions and elections overturned by military coups. The
  1990s period of "semi-democracy" (in which the army controlled the
  executive but allowed legislative elections) is a questionable inclusion

# Case notes

## Thaksin Shinawatra, Thai Rak Thai, Phak Phalang Prachachon, Pheu Thai

Thai Rak Thai (Thais Love Thailand, TRT) was the original political
party of Thaksin Shinawatra. A telecommunications entrepreneur from
Chang Mai, Thaksin was the country's richest man in the 1990s when he
served briefly in two governments as Foreign Minister (1994-95) and
twice as Deputy Prime Minister (1996, 1997). Following the severe
economic downturn following the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, Thaksin
founded TRT to contest in the 2001 election. After landslide victories
in that election and again in 2005, a boycotted 2006 poll was overturned
by the courts, leading to a crisis which ended up in Thaksin's overthrow
by the military in September 2006 and the banning of TRT.

After his ouster, the exiled Thaksin has been heavily involved in two
successor parties that subsequently won national elections in 2007 and
2011 -- the Phak Phalang Prachachon (People's Power Party, PPP) and Pheu
Thai (People's Party, PT), respectively. Both parties were/are
officially led by Thaksin's inner-circle loyalists and family members,
leading both to be widely seen in the literature as TRT by another name
(see Pongsudhirak 2008, 49; McCargo 2008, 340; Chen 2014a; Sawasdee
2019, 103). These parties are also seen to be closely related to the
pro-Thaksin and anti-coup "red-shirt" movement (contra to the
anti-Thaksin "yellow shirt" movement that had demonstrated in 2005-2008)
that blossomed in Bangkok after the PPP government was ousted in a
"judicial coup" of 2008 (Sinpeng and Kuhonta 2012, 397).

While Thaksin is universally called a populist in the Thailand
literature, this is problematic for two reasons. First the term
"populism" is almost always used in the programmatic sense to describe
social democratic policies "popular" among the rural poor -- not
populist political rhetoric (Hewison 2017; Hawkins and Selway 2017).
Hence the universal characterisation of TRT as a populist party in the
2001 election has more to do with its policies of subsidising health
care, forgiving agricultural loans, and providing village level
microfinance than any hostility to an "elite". TRT's 2001 campaign was
also the first in which this kind of national policy had been the
centrepiece of a campaign, as opposed to elite alliance-building reliant
on local political bosses to drive turnout in the countryside (Pasuk and
Baker 2002, 3; Choi 2005, 51) -- something that is also probably
relevant to its "populist" categorisation in the literature. Second,
while there is literature that discusses the rhetorical form of the
term, this tends to have an abstract evidence base that rarely quotes
Thaksin, other party leaders, or campaign slogans.

Nonetheless, there are enough exceptions to this rule to study TRT's
potential populism in sufficient detail. This evidence suggests that the
party's initial election in 2001, while based on some anti-corruption
platforms and a vaguely economic-nationalist (anti-IMF) reaction to the
1997 crisis, did not include any fundamental anti-elite populist
narratives and should not be included in the dataset (see Pasuk and
Baker 2008, 65; Hewison 2010, 121; Hawkins and Selway 2017, 384; Hewison
2017, 432; Thompson 2012, 68). Exactly when TRT and successor parties
transitioned to an anti-elite populist discourse is debated in the
literature. Pasuk and Baker suggest Thaksin's reaction to the 2001
constitutional court case in which he was accused of violating asset
disclosure rules while a minister in the 1990s (Pasuk and Baker 2004).
When awaiting the verdict, he publicly described the court case as a
conspiracy of the ruling elite against him and "the people" who elected
him, and that he would chose loyalty to the people over loyalty to the
court (Pasuk and Baker 2004, 5; see also Case 2007, 632).

In the years following, he further honed a discourse that (ubiquitously)
valorised the people and (more rarely) contrasted them to an elite
establishment of "old politics" (Pasuk and Baker 2008, 79--80; see also
Markou and Lasote 2015, 5; Jayasuriya and Hewison 2004, 585; Norton
2012, 49; Pasuk and Baker 2013, 609--10). In one speech in 2002 Thaksin
claimed that the government authority in Thailand had been abused to
"serve the interests of those in power... Governments have enacted laws
to sustain their own power rather than to empower the people who put
them in office" (Pasuk and Baker 2004, 8). In a typically populist
understanding of "the people", he continued that ideology should play no
role in modern parties, who should simply decide what to do based on
"the needs and desires of the people" (Pasuk and Baker 2004, 8).
According to Hewison, (Hewison 2017, 434; see also Thompson 2012, 68)
during the yellow-shirt demonstrations (after the 2005 election)
Thaksin's speeches "increasingly linked himself to his supporters and
declared them a democratic bedrock against elite-controlled
authoritarianism. Thaksin had identified an 'other'; the Bangkok-centred
elite."

After the 2006 coup, any vagueness regarding the people's enemy
disappeared in Thaksin's political discourse, as he adopted the "full
throated populism" against his elite rivals that he had been hesitant to
use earlier (Hewison 2017, 427). For example, in one speech he claimed
that "democracy was only for the elite. But now, people have filled
their stomachs. And they want more. But the elite don't want change that
will affect their already happy lives" (Hewison 2017, 436). This
anti-elite rhetoric has been evident in the red-shirt protests (UDD)
that started in 2008 (note that it is generally accepted in the
literature that red-shirts and pro-Thaksin parties -- particularly Pheu
Thai -- are fused entities (see Sinpeng and Kuhonta 2012; Sinpeng 2014).
In one speech Thaksin referred to a "power beyond the constitution" and
an "invisible hand" as responsible for his over through (Winichakul
2014, 96, 104), following which the term "*ammat*" (or alternatively,
"*aphichon*") entered political discourse in reference to the
aristocratic elite -- i.e. the military, privy councillors, the
democratic party, yellow-shirt protest leaders, and arguably (and
controversially) the monarchy (Sinpeng and Kuhonta 2012, 411; Pintobtan
2011, 2--3; Nelson 2012, 17; Charoensin-o-larn 2013, 206). *Ammat* is
juxtaposed against the *prai/phrai* ("people") who back Thaksin and his
parties.

Thaksin is therefore another case in which OTH_POLCLASS rhetoric clearly
rose from a small base, but where it is difficult to pin this down to
clear points in time. Following the literature, we have coded TRT 2 for
the 2005 election, and PPP & PT 3 after the 2006 coup (2007 and 2011
elections), although there may be a case to code 3 in 2005. Likewise,
there is no evidence of anti-military rhetoric from Thaksin until after
the 2006 coup (Connors 2005, 366; Charoensin-o-larn 2013, 206), after
which this became a sustained element of his populism (OTH_MILITARY = 1
in 2005, =3 2007-11).

It is often suggested that there were nationalistic elements to
Thaksin's politics, particularly relating to the fallout from the Asian
Financial Crisis and the counter-IMF common at the time (Glassman 2004;
Jayasuriya and Hewison 2004; McCargo and Pathmanand 2005, 5;
Phatharathananunth 2008, 108; Pye and Schaffar 2008, 46). As Prime
Minister he also occasionally clashed with foreign funded NGOs and the
foreign press, considering them both to be threats to "Thai sovereignty"
(Pasuk and Baker 2004, 17--18; Pasuk 2004, 4). This however only seems
to be a mild form of OTH_FOREIGN rhetoric rather than a core element of
Thaksin's populist discourse, and one that disappeared after the 2006
coup, when foreign powers do not seem very relevant to Thaksin/red shirt
populist narrative (= 2 in 2005, = 1 2007- ). As the country's richest
man, he also did not present any OTH_ECONOMIC populism -- on the
contrary he promoted entrepreneurialism among the Thai population and
claimed that his business expertise was the basis of his governing
ability (=1).

There is also no evidence of OTH_ETHNIC populism. In fact Thaksin and
many members of his government were from the minority Chinese community
-- an economically powerful community that had been somewhat political
marginalised, and the TRT era is considered by some to have reduced this
marginalisation and produced more acceptance of Chinese-Thai culture and
politicians (Pasuk and Baker 2004, 11). In his first term he enacted
harsh policies toward refugees and migrants from Myanmar and Cambodia,
but there is no evidence that this was a particularly important
component of his populist discourse (OTH_IMMIGRANT =1) when it started.

Thaksin is very difficult to categorise on a left-right ideological
basis (see Hewison 2010, 120). His most well-known economic policies
(see above) are generally socially democratic. However he clearly had a
generally neo-liberal view of economic policy and was hostile to
bureaucracy and state intervention in general (Pasuk and Baker 2008,
64). He occasionally claimed that he was applying a "dual track"
economic policy of socialism and capitalism in equal measure (Ungpakorn
2007, 16; Pasuk and Baker 2004, 10). Given his core economic philosophy
was more neo-liberal than leftist, We have coded him CR on LRPOSITION
here -- but this could be disputed. There is less debate about the role
of charisma in Thaksin's populism, given that he dominated the identity
of his parties to the exclusion of all other senior members, and later
incarnations in particular are personality cults around his leadership
(Pasuk and Baker 2008, 69, 76; see also Seo 2019, 556; Sawasdee 2019,
112; Thompson 2012, 75; Pasuk and Baker 2013, 610) (CHARISMA = 3). As
his first election coded in the dataset is 2005, his incumbency since
2001 gives him 3 on INSIDER. Incidentally, he would have been a 2 in
2001, given that he had served as deputy PM and cabinet minister in the
1990s, and relied on many state connections to develop his business
career (Pasuk and Baker 2002, 3; McCargo 2002, 115).

In government, Thaksin opposed liberal democratic norms in numerous ways
(Jayasuriya and Hewison 2004, 572; Ferrara 2015, 361). He clashed with
many of the oversight authorities which had been set up by the liberal
1997 constitution: questioning the authority of courts and sending
emissaries to pressure judges (McCargo and Pathmanand 2005, 16;
Pongsudhirak 2008, 54); clamping down on protest rights (Pasuk and Baker
2004, 19--20); taking personal control of the police (Funston 2002, 313;
Pasuk and Baker 2004, 20); and packing state institutions with family
members and demoting politicians who clashed with them (Pasuk and Baker
2004, 12). On several occasions he likened himself to Thai dictators of
previous eras (Pasuk and Baker 2004, 70) and articulated an
authoritarian vision of centralised power which included no space for
political debate -- this being supposedly redundant given that serving
the people was an obvious and uncontentious policy that required no
ideological split (Pasuk and Baker 2004, 15; Jayasuriya and Hewison
2004, 585). He was particularly hostile to media freedom, using his
state power and financial resources to supress critical coverage of his
government (Lee 2014, 180; McCargo and Pathmanand 2005, 1; Pasuk and
Baker 2004; 2008, 70; Nelson 2007, 22; Funston 2002, 313) and suing
individual journalists who provided negative coverage (Pye and Schaffar
2008, 51). Thaksin's war on drugs in the south of the country was also
highly illiberal, including summary executions which he dismissed as
"not an unusual fate for wicked people" (Mutebi 2004; see also Connors
2005, 377; Pongsudhirak 2008, 48). All of this clearly warrants a coding
of 3 for LIBDEMNORMS.

## Future Forward

The Future Forward (*Phak Anakhot Mai*, FF) party of young billionaire
car parts mogul Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit appeared for the first
time in the 2019 election and beat all expectations by winning 18%,
mainly among younger and urban voters around Bangkok (Sawasdee 2020,
65). FF was highly progressive on social issues, and became known for
its leader's confrontational style and opposition to the military junta
(McCargo and Alexander 2019, 95; Kongkirati 2019, 164).

This is a debatable inclusion, but on the balance of evidence it does
seem that Thanathorn's discourse against the military and the political
establishment did reach the level of populism by our definition. In the
words of McCargo (McCargo 2019b, 127) "his public criticisms of the
military could be bold to the point of unthinkable", and party activists
claimed that the party's mission was to "oppose hierarchism"
(OTH_POLCLASS = 3, OTH_MILITARY = 3). We have seen no other evidence of
OTH_ECONOMIC, OTH_IMMIGRANT or OTH_ETHNIC (all = 1). All analysis
emphasises the central role of Thanathorn's personality in the party's
performance (McCargo and Alexander 2019, 95, 100) (CHARISMA = 3) and
there is no evidence of INSIDER (= 1) or LIBDEMNORMS (= 1). Given its
characterisation as "progressive" on policy positions (McCargo 2019a,
156)(McCargo, 2019a:156) we have coded FF CL on LRPOSITION.

## Not included

In the early 1990s a division opened up between the pro-and
anti-military factions of the political establishment following the 1992
Black May massacre. Two figures in the anti-military camp are
occasionally considered populist in the literature. General Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh's **National Aspiration Party** was one of these, and was
briefly in power before being thrown out after the 1997 crisis. Chavalit
does seem to have a history of anti-elite statements (Neher 1988, 193),
but it seems that NAP's designation as "populist" is usually due to its
policies rather than its rhetoric (Ockey 2005, 742; Ungpakorn 2007,
112), and there is insufficient evidence that it should be included
here. A somewhat stronger case could be made for General Chamlong
Srimuang, a moral "puritan" (Chen 2014b, 195) of national politics who
led the May 1992 uprising. Chamlong is considered a "populist figure" by
some for this reason (McCargo and Pathmanand 2005, 8), but as with
Chavalit we have not seen enough evidence of genuine populist rhetoric.
Chamlong's ***Palang Dharma*** was the party under which Thaksin first
entered politics.
