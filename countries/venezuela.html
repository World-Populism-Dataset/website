<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="hugo-chávez">Hugo Chávez</h2>
<p>Populism in Venezuela is mostly linked to Hugo Chávez’s “Bolivarian Revolution”. There are significant differences in the tone, aggressiveness and rhetoric of Chávez before and after winning the 1998 elections, although he defended a similar ideology based on revolutionizing Venezuelan politics, opposing the decadent political regime and combatting neoliberal policies. In a couple of interviews before the election, he assured he would not nationalize any media company, he welcomed foreign investment (Ramos, 1998) and he argued in favor of private ownership of certain industries (tourism, lottery, banking) (Bayly, 1998). According to Scocozza and Colucciello (2016: 29), the real increase in aggressiveness came after winning the election as a way of marking a breaking point with the previous political establishment and particularly after the 2002 failed coup d’état against him. Maduro’s presidency has seen a general deterioration of the political situation in Venezuela, an exacerbation of Chávez’s rhetoric and an intensification in political repression.</p>
<p>Chávez’s initial political rhetoric focused on the idea of revolution, on a symbolic and mythic connection with the heroes of the Venezuelan past, particularly of Bolívar, on constant messages to his Christian values and on the call for a “proceso constituyente”, that is, for the creation of a new constitution that would give power to the people.</p>
<p>Chávez argued forcefully for the creation of a new political era. This was explicitly mentioned in his address to the Congress when debating the new constitution and in his rejection of the previous political system by saying that the “IV Republic was born with the applause of the conservative oligarchy” (Scocozza and Colucciello, 2016: 33). Moreover, Roberts (2012: 145) argues that “Chávez deined the enemy primarily in terms of the political establishment against which he had launched his ill-fated coup attempt in 1992. In particular, he condemned the leaders of AD and COPEI as a corrupt, entrenched, and self-serving political elite that made a farce of representative democracy”. Therefore, Chávez can be coded as number 3 in Political Class throughout all the elections.</p>
<p>However, his classification in left-right axis and against the financial elite is less clear in the 1998 and 2000 election campaigns. Slogans such as “homeland, socialism or death” or “Socialism of the XXI century” did not gain relevance until after the failed coup (Scocozza and Colucciello, 2016: 30). On his first electoral campaign, Chávez was considerably more moderated and drove its inspiration more from nationalism than socialism (Roberts, 2012: 145; Bolívar, 2001: 47). While, on one side, Ellner (2004: 11) and Gates (2010: 3) argue that Chávez was a “staunchly anti-neoliberal” candidate in 1998 and Molina (2002: 231) points out that he based his 2000 campaign on “claims on social division between rich and poor, presenting himself as a friend of the poor and an enemy of the oligarchs”, on the other side, Roberts (2012: 146), drawing on Blanco Muñoz (1998: 611–14), defends that “Chavismo could deine itself in opposition to international capital and globalized neoliberalism, without rejecting capitalism or capitalists per se. Indeed, Chávez came to power advocating a ‘humanistic’ mixed economy that borrowed from both capitalist and socialist development models, with a market freed from monopoly control and a developmentalist state committed to nurturing national producers, both public and private”. In fact, he even rejected the label of “socialist” in favor of “Bolivarian” before the 1998 elections (Bayly, 1998). Nevertheless, since the dataset is thought off as global, in a comparison with other parties throughout the world, it is still possible to code MVR as far-left and opposed to the financial elite. It suffices to point out that it was after the period of 2004 when socialism really became the center of Chávez’s political discourse with the creation of the “New strategic map of the Bolivarian Revolution” (Colmenares, 2011: 11). On the 2012 election, this was clear, for example, when he attacked his political opponent as a “lackey of imperialism” and a “lackey of the bourgeoisie” (Scocozza and Colucciello, 2016: 33).</p>
<p>Immigration to Venezuela is rarely mentioned in Chavez’s discourses or in academic texts on his politics. In fact, he carried on mass nationalizations of immigrants in 2003 under the project “Misión Identidad”. Thus, he is a 1 in immigration under the Dataset definition (a different issue is Chavez's view on Venezuelan emigration).</p>
<p>Being a soldier himself and having created a movement inside the military that preceded his political party (“Movimiento Bolivariano Revolucionario 200” (MBR-200)), Chávez did not associate the military with the elite, in fact, the military was seen as a possible agent of revolutionary change (Colmenares, 2011: 9). In the 2012 election Chávez explicitly praised the military for “being committed, as the working class, with the Bolivarian Constitution” (Scocozza and Colucciello, 2016: 33).</p>
<p>Chávez had nationalism and retrieving popular sovereignty as central axis of his 1998 campaign. He started his inaugural speech with a reference to the “father of the homeland”, Simón Bolívar, that summed up his nationalist discourse: “Blessed is the citizen who, under the coat of arms of his command, summons national sovereignty to exercise his absolute will” (Chávez, 1999). As some authors have stressed, populism in Latin America is “inclusionary” of groups that previously felt excluded such as working class or indigenous citizens and not based on the exclusion of ethnic “aliens” such as European right-wing populism (Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser, 2013). In fact, Chávez stressed constantly his commitment to Americanismo and to Bolívar’s notion of Gran Patria, that is, the vision of a common interest and identity to all Latin American countries (Colmenares, 2011: 9). Chávez repeated constantly his commitment to the improvement of the indigenous communities, however, he did not identify with one particular ethnic group. The 1999 constitution declared Venezuela to be “multiethnic and pluricultural”. Moreover, he did not make this the main axis of his politics, but instead understood the fight for indigenous people as one aspect of the larger struggle between the people and the elite. Taking this into consideration, I have coded 1 for Ethnic others, regions.</p>
<p>Roberts (2012: 145) has argued that “while Chávez had always been critical of U.S. imperialism and its ties to elite interests in Venezuelan society, he intensified his critique in response to Washington’s thinly veiled support for the military coup that briefly removed him from office in April 2002”. Moreover, in an interview with Bayly (1998), he stresses the desire of collaboration with the IMF and other international institutions. Attending to this criterion, I have coded 2 for foreign interest in the 1998 and 2000 elections and a 3 since the 2006 election.</p>
<p>Chávez was a well-known character in Venezuelan politics before his election in 1998, particularly after his failed coup on 1992. However, he did not hold any office before becoming president. Thus, he is coded as a 1 in Insider Populism in 1998 and a 3 in the rest of elections.</p>
<p>There is much debate over the characterization of Venezuela as a democracy or as a dictatorship. Freedom House (2017) considers the country “Partly Free” until 2017, where it becomes “Not Free” and Polity IV (2014) considers it an open anocracy since 2007. Chávez took over the years a series of measures that threatened political pluralism and freedom of the press. He dissolved the opposition-controlled Congress in favor of a Chávez-leaning Constituent Assembly, he extended the powers of the president by weakening checks and balances against the executive branch, the new constitution made no mention to political parties, he replaced many military officials and oil company managers with men close to him, he changed the electoral system to favor his political party and took control over some media companies (Colmenares, 2011: 33; Roberts, 2012). In 2006, the opposition decided not to participate in the elections as a protest against their “undemocratic nature”. However, formally, Venezuela continued to be a democracy and Chávez passed these reforms in several referenda. Although there is a significant difference between measures taken by Chávez and measures taken under Maduro’s government, such as the imprisonment of political opponents like Leopoldo López or Antonio Ledezma, overall, actions taken by both governments can be considered as a radical break with previous liberal democracy norms.</p>
<p>There is a clear cult around Hugo Chávez in his movement and he identified directly with the people. He argued repeatedly that “Chávez is not just a man, but that Chávez is a people” (Michelutti, 2017). Nevertheless, the political system before his victory in 1998 showed clear signs of decomposition and all candidates in that election where anti-establishment (Molina, 2002). Thus, it is possible to imagine that another, maybe less successful, Bolivarian movement could have emerged in 1998. After Chávez’s death, there was plenty debate over if Chavismo would survive under Maduro’s leadership, which it has done. However, Maduro draws his support from Chávez’s charisma, and it is perfectly imaginable that another politician could have taken its place.</p>

<section id="movement-for-socialism" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="movement-for-socialism">Movement for Socialism</h2>
<p>Movement for Socialism (“Movimiento al Socialismo/MAS”) is a very difficult party to classify. It emerged from a split from the Communist party criticizing harshly its verticality and authoritarianism and defending a deeper democratization of both parties and institutions (Petkoff, 1989b). Moreover, it aimed at the combination of democratic freedoms and social justice (Petkoff, 1989a). Ideologically, it is on the far-left because it seeks the public ownership of the productive system and to control financial elites, but it should be stressed that the party underwent an important de-radicalization compared to the Communist party. I have coded 3 on Financial because, although from Petkoff’s assessment, the party was focused on criticizing political parties, their ideological position accounts for their opposition to the bourgeoisie as the financial elite.</p>
<p>Although it emerges with a clear criticism to the “bipartidism” of the moment, the elites (“cogollos”) and the burocratization of power (Petkoff, 1989b), its main proposal to renovate politics is deepening the democratization of parties and institutions, exemplified by institutionalizing in its own party the existence of diverse tendencies. Petkoff, the presidential candidate in 1983 and 1988, stresses these measures as the real revolution but there is little of the stark distinction between elite and people. In this sense, in the 80s it is closer to non-populist parties that criticize the political system such as Ciudadanos or Macron in Europe than to Podemos. In the presidential elections in the 80s, their candidate won less than 5% of the vote and in the 90s the party supported other candidates. They supported two presidential candidates very far ideologically; Rafael Caldera and Hugo Chávez in the presidential elections of 1993 and 1998, respectively. It is this last election in which we can see a more populist and radical stance (Lalander, 2008), however, this support provoked many divisions and splits within the party between supporters and critics of Chávez. I have coded a 1 for violation of liberal norms due to its stress with democratizing parties and institutions (Petkoff, 1989a) and 1 for Insider Populism because the leaders of the party were known political leaders but held no governmental position.</p>
</section>
<section id="radical-cause-and-others" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="radical-cause-and-others">Radical Cause and others</h2>
<p>Radical Cause (“Causa Я”) is a clear antecedent to Chávez. It was the main party of the opposition to Caldera in the 1993 election and Lalander (2008: 40) points that it was “the party closest to Chávez and that a great number of their militants, union leaders and MPs would later be part of ‘Chavismo’”. Thus, I have coded them in a similar fashion as MVR for the 1993 election and again in the 2000 election in which it was the main party of the opposition in the presidential election. The 2000 election shows the relevance of the populist discourse of Chávez because the candidate of Radical Cause was one of the colleagues of Chávez in the 1992 failed coup d’état.</p>
<p>The same is essentially true for Fatherland for all (“Pátria para todos”) and For Social Democracy (“Por la Democracia Social /Podemos”) which are satellite parties of Chávez in the 2005 election which did not wish to become part of his vertical party structure.</p>
