<section id="stanisław-tymiñski-party-x" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="stanisław-tymiñski-party-x">Stanisław Tymiñski / Party X</h2>
<p>Stanisław Tymiński, a Polish-Canadian businessman, ran an unlikely presidential campaign in 1990 with his newly founded “Party X”. Although he started with very little name recognition, he surprised all observers by coming second in the first ballot (23.1%), although he only increased this to 25.75% in the second where he was roundly defeated by Solidarity’s Lech Wełeşa. Party X did not do well in following year’s legislative elections (0.5%), and Tymiński did not play an important role in Polish politics afterward.</p>
<p>Tymiński’s campaign consisted of a personality centric diatribe against the political class – including both the post-communist and Solidarity factions – calling himself a “third force” that was neither left nor right wing (de Lange &amp; Guerra, 2009:535; Stanley &amp; Cześnik, 2019:70; Jasiewicz, 2008:22; Kucharczyk &amp; Wysocka, 2008:80; Bartkowski, 1991:80) (OTH_POLCLASS = 3). For this his 1990 campaign is universally considered “populist” (see: Pankowski, 2010:66; Surazska &amp; Bivand, 1997:76; Millard, 1994:54; van Kessel, 2015:124). While his policy proposals were light, his “entrepreneurial populism” (Kasprowicz &amp; Hess, 2017:204) was built on the idea that as a successful business man he could create wealth for the people (Sanford, 2002:178; Schöpflin, 1991:239), generally catering to those who felt that they had lost out in the transition to a market system under Solidarity (Surazska &amp; Bivand, 1997:76; Bell, 1997:1268; Sanford, 2002:178). This makes him difficult to code on LRPOSITION, but I’ve called him C.</p>
<p>Not a lot is written about his platform, but Rok (1992) claims that Tymiński was anti-semitic, and other sources claim that party supporters exhibited high levels of xenophobia (Jasiewicz, 2008:22). While there is not a lot of evidedence to corroborate this, I’ve coded him 2 on OTH_ETHNIC. I’ve seen no evidence for anything registering on the OTH_IMMIGRANT (= 1). According to Bartkowski (1991), which is one of the richest sources available, anti-western sentiment was cornerstone of Tymiński’s appeal. He accused the west of economically colonising Poland via privatisations, and claimed that the political elite were willing to sell the country out to foreign economic interests (Bartkowski, 1991:77). This does not appear in any other observed source, but given the depth of this analysis OTH_FOREIGN is coded 3. As a “self-made” millionaire, he did not present any hostility to the rich (Schöpflin, 1991:248) (OTH_FINANCIAL = 1) The party was based totally on Tymiński’s persuasive (Jasiewicz, 2008:22) and “eccentric” (Bell, 1997:1270) persona (Schöpflin, 1991:239) (CHARISMA = 3). Tyminski had no affiliation with the political class, and no established party organisation (Bell, 1997:1267) (INSIDER = 1). I’ve seen no evidence that he violated LIBDEMNORMS (= 1).</p>
</section>
<section id="league-of-polish-families" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="league-of-polish-families">League of Polish Families</h2>
<p>The League of Polish Families (<em>Liga Polskich Rodzin</em>, LPR), founded in 2001, was a clerical social conservative party that was puritanically anti-EU and opposed to foreign influences in “traditional” Polish (Catholic) culture. The party was the product of conservative Father and media figure Tadeusz Rydzyk, who cobbled together various right wing and Catholic parties in existence at the time (Pankowski, 2010:111). After two strong performances in 2001 and 2005 (7.9% and 8% respectively), the party joined a coalition government with Civic Platform and Order and Justice, after which it was seen by supporters to compromise too much on its program and receded by the early 2007 elections. Most of its voters turned to PiS (Zuba, 2017:91).</p>
<p>Anti-establishment rhetoric was an important pillar of LPR’s discourse (de Lange &amp; Guerra, 2009:539; Zuba, 2017:100), as it frequently accused the political class of conspiring with foreigners to subvert Polish values and interests. Several scholars point out that the party’s anti-establishment rhetoric was not as extreme as other populists at the time (notably Self Defence) (Markowski &amp; Tucker, 2010:526), but from the available evidence this should still be coded as 3 in the OTH_POLCLASS variable. The party had a generally ethnocentric outlook on the nation (Jasiewicz, 2008:15; Moroska &amp; Zuba, 2010:131), and according to de Lange &amp; Guerra, (2009:538) it “vehemently opposes” non-Catholic “others”, and “openly attacks the roles that Jews” have in society. Members of affiliated youth movements (MW, see below) also promoted explicitly anti-Semitic doctrines (Pankowski, 2010:116). For this I have coded the party 3 on OTH_ETHNIC. Immigration was not high enough during LPR’s time in parliament to register in its populism (Moroska &amp; Zuba, 2010:131). That said, de Lange &amp; Guerra, (2009:539) record that a number of LPR politicians made statements against immigration on cultural grounds. I’ve left OTH_IMMIGRANT at 1 for now, but there is a case to be made that it should be 2.</p>
<p>Opposition to European integration was the definitive policy of the party (Moroska &amp; Zuba, 2010:130; Jasiewicz, 2008:15; de Lange &amp; Guerra, 2009:537; Markowski &amp; Tucker, 2010), as it considered European liberal values to be antithetical to conservative Polish ones (Jasiewicz, 2008:11). Polish politicians sympathetic to EU integration were accused of “anti-Polish” politics (Moroska &amp; Zuba, 2010:131). Numerous members also made statements alleging that Germans and Jews were the principle beneficiaries of the EU’s schemes (Jasiewicz, 2008:15).This tied in with its generally nationalist outlook that frequently alleged that foreign interests of conspiring against Polish ones (Pankowski, 2010:113) (OTH_FOREIGN = 3). The party opposed foreign investment in Poland (de Lange &amp; Guerra, 2009:539), but in more of a nationalist than an economic sense. Giertych did however accuse Poland’s new business elite of conspiring with foreign interests and former communist officials (Pankowski, 2010:113), and for this reason I’ve coded it 2 on OTH_FINANCIAL.</p>
<p>While there is an argument that the party shifted somewhat in its 7 years in Parliament, based on the above policies I have labelled the party FR on LRPOSITION, and it is usually considered so by scholars (Wysocka, 2013:295; Pankowski, 2010:113; Markowski &amp; Tucker, 2010:526). Father Tadeusz Rydyk, owner of a media empire that included the influential Radio Maryja, was a charismatic influence in founding and endorsing the party (Zuba, 2017:90; Moroska &amp; Zuba, 2010:127; Pankowski, 2010:111; Jasiewicz, 2008:15; Stanley &amp; Cześnik, 2019:72). While he was never actually leader, I’ve coded it 2 on CHARISMA for the 2001 elections given his direct relationship to the meaning of the party. Subsequently, the young Roman Giertych took over and established himself as a charismatic leader (Millard, 2006:1017; Kucharczyk &amp; Wysocka: 2008:78) (especially via a committee post that empowered him to investigate corruption, see: Pankowski, 2010: 112-13), albeit of a party with a strong base. Therefore I’ve kept the CHARISMA coding at 2 for the 2005 and 2007 elections.</p>
<p>The party had direct links with the All-Polish Youth (<em>Młodzież Wszechpolska</em>, MW) (Kucharczyk &amp; Wysocka: 2008:78), a radical and violent nationalist street movement whose members “came to dominate the wider party organisation” (Pankowski, 2010:112, 116). MW members intimidated opponents or the LPR and targeted LGBT, feminist and Jewish organisations in particular (Pankowski, 2010:113-16). For this reason I have coded it 3 for LIBDEMNORMS. The party and its leaders had not participated in government before joining in coalition with PiS following the 2005 election (Millard, 2009:791), after which (2007 election) I have coded it 2 on INSIDER.</p>
</section>
<section id="self-defence" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="self-defence">Self Defence</h2>
<p>Self Defence (<em>Samoobrona Rzeczpospolitej Polskiej,</em> SRP) was long an agrarian trade union before it became a political party, even though it sent candidates to run for office from the 1990s. Appealing to the rural “losers” of the post-communist transition, it was seen by many to espouse a nostalgia for the former regime, albeit with some nationalist ideas (Pankowski, 2010:132). It achieved a breakthrough performance of 10.2% in 2001, and Lepper polled 15.1% in the 2005 presidential election before the party receded to 1.5% in 2007. It briefly served in coalition government with PiS and LPR between 2005 and 2007. The party was totally dominated by its founder-leader Andrzej Lepper, and the inconsistency of many of its (his) positions makes it very difficult to code.</p>
<p>One aspect of the SRP that was not at all ambiguous was that it was “anti-establishment by nature” (Moroska &amp; Zuba, 2010:132). Lepper self-identified as “populist” campaigning for the ordinary citizen against the “self-proclaimed new elites” (Jasiewicz, 2008:13; see also van Kessel, 2015:125), thus tapping into a growing cynicism of the political class among voters (Szczerbiak, 2007:212) (OTH_POLCLASS = 3). It also often espoused xenophobia, especially towards Germans (Moroska &amp; Zuba, 2010:130) and Jews, who Lepper has called “the most dangerous nation for Poland” (Pankowski, 2010:139). While there is a case to be made that the ambiguity, inconsistency, and unpredictability of these positions should dampen their place in the party’s core outlook, I’ve labelled SRP 3 on OTH_ETHNIC. I’ve seen no evidence that the party was concerned with OTH_IMMIGRANTS (= 1), although this may be wrong.</p>
<p>In its more nationalist tones, the party alleged that foreign interests interfered with the Polish economy. It was occasionally opposed to EU integration, arguing that it would harm the wellbeing of ordinary farmers and enrich a small elite (Jasiewicz, 2008:11; Stanley &amp; Cześnik, 2019:71). For this the party earns a 2 on OTH_FOREIGN (there is a case to be made that this should be 3). Moroska &amp; Zuba, (2010:133) claim that the party stood against foreign capital and capitalists, and much of its early political activities were aimed at opposing debt collectors and high interest charging banks repossessing farms (Pankowski, 2010:133; Markowski &amp; Tucker, 2010:527). (OTH_FINANCIAL = 3).</p>
<p>The party’s ideology was ambiguous and erratic (Pankowski, 2010:135) – even to the point that some have called it non-ideological. This was in part due to the fact that Lepper’s charismatic leadership was essence of its political meaning (Jasiewicz, 2008:14; Pankowski, 2010:142) (CHARISMA = 3). In the words of Moroska &amp; Zuba, (2010:129), “Andrzej Lepper consequently became not only the person who expressed his party’s position, but also a spontaneous creator of that position.” While the party has occasionally been considered left wing (Jasiewicz, 2008:11; de Lange &amp; Guerra, 2009:537; Markowski &amp; Tucker, 2010:527; see also Pankowski, 2010:135), the preponderance of evidence suggests that it espoused no actual ideology other than a vague championing of the rural poor (Moroska &amp; Zuba, 2010:130, 132), and Lepper himself seemed to stress different ideological labels at different time, and at other suggested that it was neither left, right or centre, but just “patriotic” (Pankowski, 2010:136). I’ve therefore coded its LRPOSITION at C.</p>
<p>As a social movement, Self Defense often held rallies that were accused of violence and lawlessness (Pankowski, 2010:132-3; Markowski &amp; Tucker, 2010:527), and when in Parliament Lepper often brought in PA speakers to drown out the other members when he wanted to drown out other members (Jasiewicz, 2008:13). According to Pankowski (2010), this image of anti-system lawlessness was a key part of the party’s image and appeal (LIBDEMNORMS = 3). The party was never in government before joining a coalition in 2005, after which (2007) it is coded 2 on INSIDER.</p>
</section>
<section id="law-and-justice" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="law-and-justice">Law and Justice</h2>
<p>Law and Justice (<em>Prawo i Sprawiedliwość</em>, PiS) is the party of brothers Jarosław and (the late) Lech Kaczyński, two senior members of the Solidarity movement that took a particularly hard line on the role of ex-communists in the new regime in the 1990s. The brothers initially created the Centre Agreement party in the early 1990s, but without a populist stance nor significant electoral success. After Lech’s stint as Minister of Justice in the centre right Buzek government in which he became popular for fighting corruption (Millard, 2009:790-91), the brothers founded PiS in 2001, gaining 9.5% in that election. In 2005 Lech Kaczyński won the presidency and the party entered minority “populist coalition” government with the LPR and SRP, which collapsed in 2007. While its coalition partners faded in that vote, PiS saw its popularity rise (essentially swallowing the supporters of its two coalition partners), only more so after the death of Lech in a plane crash in Russia in 2010. PiS formed government outright in 2015, when it also retook the presidency. In many of the OTH_ variables, PiS is noted to have made a steady shift away from the centre towards radicalism, particularly by the time of its 2005 and 2007 elections (Jasiewicz, 2008:23; Markowski &amp; Tucker, 2010:528; Pankowski, 2010; Vermeersch, 2007), which makes its early elections (2001 in particular) slightly difficult to code.</p>
<p>The party advocated a “fourth republic” that would rid the polity of the corrupt leadership which characterised the third republic (as the post 1989 state had been known) (Jasiewicz, 2008:9; Wysocka, 2013:303; Kucharczyk &amp; Wysocka: 2008:79; see also Markovski, 2008:1056). It targeted what it called the <em>uklad</em> (“network” or “pact”) of elites – ex-communist officials, corrupt post-solidarity politicians, and foreign influences – whom it alleged ran the state: “The network has taken everything for itself. That explains why, after 1989, the people have not had a chance” (cited in Wysocka, 2013:303). There are several scholars who think that PiS only really adopted anti-political class populism by 2005 (van Kessel, 2015:121) or that it was radicalised by 2007 (Jasiewicz, 2008:23; Markowski &amp; Tucker, 2010:528). Stanley &amp; Cześnik (2019:73) persuasively argue that the party was hostile to corruption in 2001, but not nearly as radical as the LPR and SRP (see also Pankowski, 2010:153). Therefore I’ve coded it 2 on OTH_POLCLASS in 2001, and 3 from 2005 on. There is some suggestion that PiS had a more moderate and less confrontation stance in the 2010 presidential election (Szczerbiak, 2013:485), but not enough evidence to justify changing the coding.</p>
<p>The PiS clearly considered the “people” in ethnic and sectarian (Catholic) terms, especially after it inherited the nationalist far-right mantle of the LPR by 2007 and the support of the fundamentalist Radio Maryja with it (Pankowski and Kornak, 2013:162). Over time Jarosław Kaczyński made statements to the effect that he had been mistaken to oppose anti-semitism in the past (Pankowski, 2010:155), and the party included some known anti-semitic politicians in its ranks (Pankowski, 2010:157). There was also an infamous incident in which the party and its campaign managers accused Lech Kaczyński’s 2005 presidential rival Donald Tusk of being too German because his grandfather allegedly fought briefly with the Wehrmacht. His grandfather was actually from the Kashuba ethnic minority which had been forcibly conscripted by the Nazis. According to Pankowski (2010:157), this triggered ethnocentric anti-German and anti-Kashuba hostility as much as nationalist disloyalty. Amid the EU refugee crisis in 2015, PiS honed a sharply anti-Islam discourse, alleging that Muslims posed a threat to Polish society, and alleging that they had taken over neighbourhoods and churches in Western Europe (Krzyżanowska &amp; Krzyżanowski, 2018:615; Krzyżanowski, 2018). Like other variables, it is difficult to pin down precisely when this rhetoric began and what level it achieved. I’ve coded OTH_ETHNIC 1 in 2001, 2 2005-2011 and 3 from 2015 on (when anti-Muslim sentiment started to dominate). By 2015, the European Migrant crisis led the PiS to adopt a harsh xenophobic line on asylum seekers (Krzyżanowska &amp; Krzyżanowski, 2018:615; Krzyżanowski, 2018), and in doing so won over many voters “who normally never would have voted for it” (Fomina &amp; Kucharczyk, 2016:62). Before 2015 immigration was not a major topic of political discourse (Krzyżanowski, 2018:76) (OTH_IMMIGRANT = 1 2001-2011, 3 2015-).</p>
<p>A number of foreign powers are highly relevant to the PiS’s populist nationalism. Hostility toward Germany (historically a rich vein for the Polish right) was a key pillar of PiS’s politics (Wysocka, 2013:305; Szczerbiak, 2013:489), and after the 2010 crash that killed Lech the party propagated a number of conspiracy theories that alleged a Russian assassination (Stanley &amp; Cześnik, 2019:75; Szczerbiak, 2013:486) The party has also over time become thoroughly hostile to the EU, which it accuses of imposing socially liberal values on Poland – although this only developed around 2005-07 (Markowski &amp; Tucker, 2010:528). According to Pankowski, (2010:157-58), each of these oppositions were significantly milder in the 2001 election (OTH_FOREIGN = 2 in 2001, 3 from 2005). While a pro-welfare class politics has often been a pillar of the Kaczyñskis politics (Szczerbiak, 2007:218; Pankowski, 2010:163), this does not appear to rise above 1 on the OTH_FINANCIAL variable (= 1).</p>
<p>While PiS always advocated for a pro-welfare policy of state intervention in the economy (Millard, 2006:1021; Kucharczyk &amp; Wysocka: 2008:79; Szczerbiak, 2007:211), it has always been considered a party of the post-solidarity right, whose anti-communism makes it incompatible with any left wing branding. According to a number of observers (Wysocka, 2013:293; Pankowski, 2010:152) the party started off as centre right in the early 2000s, before embracing a more right wing agenda in subsequent elections. Owing to the above traits of ethnocentrism and nationalism, the party should clearly be defined as far right today (Kasprowicz &amp; Hess, 2017:204). While it is debatable exactly when this shift should take place, I’ve coded its LRPOSITION CR in 2001, R in 2005, and FR from 2007, as this election is when it is usually considered to have taken LPRs place on the far right (Jasiewicz, 2008:11).</p>
<p>The party has been defined by the personalities of the Kaczyñski twins (Jasiewicz, 2008:12; Wysocka, 2013:306) who also control it organisation totally (Pankowski, 2010:164), although according to Fomina &amp; Kucharczyk, (2016:60) the party pulled Jarosław “out of public view” for the 2015 elections. It is also worth noting that other leaders have served as Prime minister and President in its recent terms in government. Furthermore, according to some, the brothers are not actually particularly charismatic, even if they are well known. This makes the party difficult to code on CHARISMA – I’ve coded it 2, but this could possibly be 3. The brothers had actually been intimately involved with the highest levels of post-1989 politics (Jasiewicz, 2008:11; Pankowski, 2010:151), making PiS a 2 on INSIDER up to YEAR, when it formed government and is thenceforth coded 3.</p>
<p>The PiS has, from its inception until its time in government, projected a majoritirian authoritarianism that threatens liberal democratic norms (Fomina &amp; Kucharczyk, 2016; Pankowski &amp; Kornak, 2013:162). In its early manifestos, PiS made it clear that it wanted to expand the powers of the presidency (Millard, 2006:1017) and reduce those of the legislature and courts (Jasiewicz, 2008:13). It also proposed in 2003 to rewrite the constitution as an explicitly Catholic document – beginning its draft with the words “In the name of God Alighty!” and removing all references to religious and ethnic minorities (Pankowski, 2010:154). In government it has been particularly hostile to the judicial system and media scrutiny (Wysocka, 2013:306, 309) when these have been critical of the party’s interests. According to Pankowski, (2010:151), in the 2001 elections the PiS “did not challenge the basic elements of the Polish democratic system”, and hence I’ve coded it 2 on LIBDEMNORMS in that election and 3 ever since.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="palikots-movement">Palikot’s Movement</h2>
<p>Palikot’s Movement (<em>Ruch Palikota</em>, RP), was a short-lived left wing party best known for its anti-clerical stance. It was a vehicle for the flamboyant and controversial businessman Janusz Palikot, who broke from the Civic Platform in 2010 after accusing its leadership of veering too far to the right. On top of its anti-clericalism, the party advocated a number of left wing stances, such as drug liberalisation, legalised abortion, and LGBT rights (Szczerbiak, 2013:489). The party performed surprisingly well with 10.02%in the 2011 election, but after significant internal divisions waned into insignificance by the 2015 polls, by which time it was a member of a left coalition that could not be considered populist.</p>
<p>Palikot’s populism targeted the power of the Church in Polish politics: “The Church is not so holy. It is a greedy political party that tries at any cost to keep a firm hand on its own interests” (cited in Zuba, 2017:92). Within this construction, he accused the political class of dependence on the Church (Zuba, 2017:100; see also Fomina &amp; Kucharczyk, 2016:61), and maintained a generally anti-establishment character (Szczerbiak, 2013:489; van Kessel, 2015:130) – even to the point of saying that he and his nemesis Jarosław Kaczyński were alike in their “being against the system” (Wróbel, 2011:450). In the party’s own anti-political class words: ‘[w]e are not the next configuration of the same old elite . . . AWS, PiS, PO, ZChN, PC, KPN, ROP, and now PJN – different names, but the same people’ (cited in Stanley &amp; Cześnik, 2011:706) (OTH_POLCLASS = 3).</p>
<p>Palikot ran a very business-friendly campaign promising liberal small government (Szczerbiak, 2013:489) (OTH_FINANCIAL = 1), and while the party is usually considered left wing (Zuba, 2017; Szczerbiak, 2013; Sokołowski, 2012), this has much more to do with social policy than economic policy – which by all accounts was a more important pillar of the party’s image (Stanley &amp; Cześnik, 2011:707) (LRPOSITION = L). There is no evidence for anything on the OTH_ETHNIC, OTH_IMMIGRANT, or OTH_FOREIGN variables, which are all coded 1. As its name suggests it was totally dominated by its leader (Zuba, 2017:92; Kosowska-Gąstoł &amp; Sobolewska-Myślik, 2019:14) (CHARISMA = 3), and there is no evidence that it violated LIBDEMNORMS (= 1). Despite being a well-known deputy in the PO government until 2010, Palikot wasn’t really powerful or established enough to be an INSIDER (= 1) (Kosowska-Gąstoł &amp; Sobolewska-Myślik, 2019:15).</p>

<section id="kukiz15" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="kukiz15">Kukiz’15</h2>
<p>The Association for a New Constitution Kukiz’15 (Stowarzyszenienarzecz Nowej Konstytucji Kukiz’15, Kukiz’15), was the creation of rock singer Paweł Kukiz, who gradually became active in politics in the 2000s-2010s. Originally affiliated with the Civic Platform, his main concern grew into constitutional reform of the electoral system, advocating the adoption of single member districts. Kukiz stood in the 2015 presidential, where he added a holistic criticism of the political class to his calls for electoral reform, picking up a surprising 20.8% to place third. Months later, he built on this momentum by creating an “association” to contest the parliamentary elections on broadly the same campaign themes. Despite winning 42 seats, the group collapsed early in the term due to internal disagreements. Both campaigns relied heavily on online platforms (Facebook and Twitter in particular) and were targeted at young voters (Kasprowicz &amp; Hess, 2017:212; Olczyk &amp; Wasilewski, 2016; Stanley &amp; Cześnik, 2019:83).</p>
<p>Kukiz’15 is frequently regarded as “anti-establishment” (Fomina &amp; Kucharczyk, 2016:60; Zuba, 2017:100; Stanley &amp; Cześnik, 2019:75; Olczyk &amp; Wasilewski, 2016:58; Lipiński &amp; Stępińska, 2019:72), and “anti-system” (Kosowska-Gąstoł &amp; Sobolewska-Myślik, 2019:22; Stanley &amp; Cześnik, 2019:81; Szczerbiak, 2018) for its total rejection of the political class, which it regarded as corrupt and oligarchic (Kosowska-Gąstoł &amp; Sobolewska-Myślik, 2019:16; Kosowska-Gąstoł &amp; Sobolewska-Myślik, 2017:146; Kasprowicz &amp; Hess, 2017:206; Olczyk &amp; Wasilewski, 2016:59; Stępińska <em>et al</em>, 2017:315). It propagated a narrative of the “partiocracy” – an established network of professional politicians whose parties (including both CO and PiS) only pretend to differ in any meaningful way (Stanley &amp; Cześnik, 2019:76) (OTH_POLCLASS = 3). For this reason it was very careful not to define and register itself as a party, but as an “electoral committee of voters” (Kosowska-Gąstoł &amp; Sobolewska-Myślik, 2019:15). In line with its “ordinary person” appeal, candidates for the parliamentary elections were selected by a simple online questionnaire (Kosowska-Gąstoł &amp; Sobolewska-Myślik, 2017:147) – one reason why it was so difficult to keep together after the vote.</p>
<p>While the party’s programme was (intentionally) vague (Stanley &amp; Cześnik, 2019:76), there were several core elements to its ideological outlook. Many of the party’s candidates and supporters were drawn from existing radical right parties (Kosowska-Gąstoł &amp; Sobolewska-Myślik, 2019:22), giving it a nationalist and nativist politics (Stanley &amp; Cześnik, 2019:76), often in accord with Kukiz’s own statements. According to Fomina &amp; Kucharczyk (2016:60) it “spouted anti-European, nationalist, and xenophobic slogans but had no substantive program beyond reforming the electoral system.” Furthermore, Kukiz himself made several barely-cryptic anti-Semitic statements about Poland’s role in the Holocaust and the role of Jews in the former communist regime (Pankowski, 2018:25). While there is a case to be made that this did not quite reach the level of a 3 on OTH_ETHNIC (mainly due to the vagueness of the party’s positions), I’ve coded it such for now. Opposition to Syrian refugees was an important pillar of the party’s rhetoric in 2015 (Stanley &amp; Cześnik, 2019:76; Lipiński &amp; Stępińska, 2019:72), and Wciseł (2016:28) claims that the migration crisis was the “driving force” behind the 2015 campaign, even though he vacillated between harder and softer approaches (OTH_IMMIGRANT = 3). The party was “anti-European” (Fomina &amp; Kucharczyk, 2016:60), and claimed that Poland had become a “neo-colony of foreign governments and international corporations” (cited in (Stanley &amp; Cześnik, 2019:76). It also considered tolerance of refugees to equate to political allegiance to Germany (Wciseł, 2016:28) (OTH_FOREIGN = 3). There was an element of hostility towards foreign capital in the party’s discourse (Kasprowicz &amp; Hess, 2017:210; Stanley &amp; Cześnik, 2019:76), but these policies were not as important as the party’s nativism in its political discourse (Stanley &amp; Cześnik, 2019) (OTH_FINANCIAL = 2).</p>
<p>The party’s economic ideology was very vague (Olczyk &amp; Wasilewski, 2016:57) and its formal policies were a somewhat contradictory blend of conventional left and right. This coupled with the fact that Kukiz’s music had both left and right-wing themes (Olczyk &amp; Wasilewski, 2016:58), and with the fact that its extremely open form of candidate selection produced an eclectic mix of leaders, makes it difficult to place the party on LRPOSITION (Kosowska-Gąstoł &amp; Sobolewska-Myślik, 2017:147). Stanley &amp; Cześnik (2019:85) claim that the party is actually centrist – that even though it had links and affinities with the radical right, its programme is actually vague and its appeal is built mainly on anti-political class populism. However most scholars seem to agree that the party should generally be considered “conservative”/“economic nationalis[t]” (Kosowska-Gąstoł &amp; Sobolewska-Myślik, 2019:13) and “right-wing” (Lipiński &amp; Stępińska, 2019; Szczerbiak, 2018:1; (Wciseł, 2016:28), and hence I have coded it R on LRPOSITION.</p>
<p>The party is clearly based around the persona of Kukiz himself (Olczyk &amp; Wasilewski, 2016; Kosowska-Gąstoł &amp; Sobolewska-Myślik, 2017:146; Szczerbiak:2016) (CHARISMA = 3), and was a genuinely new political force (Kosowska-Gąstoł &amp; Sobolewska-Myślik, 2019:16) (INSIDER = 1). The party was extremely hostile to media criticism, and accused the (national and global) press of being complicit in maintaining the establishment (Kasprowicz &amp; Hess, 2017:210). It is debatable whether this should land the party on LIBDEMNORMS – I’ve labelled it 2 for now.</p>

<p>There is an argument to be made that several political parties and actors from the early post-communist years should be classified as populist. The Polish Peasant Party (PSL) had a populist history that predated the communst regime, and some consider this to have lived on in the 1990s Jasiewicz (2008:9). However most scholars tend to agree that it was not genuinely populist by the time that most of its supporters were swallowed up by (the unambiguously populist) Self Defence in the 1990s (Pankowski, 2010; Markowski &amp; Tucker, 2010:528). There is also a case to be made that Lech Wełeşa himself should be considered a populist for his common man appeal and hostility to the communist political class. I however do not see that this continued into the 1990s to the extent that he should be included in the dataset.</p>
