## Italian Social Movement (MSI)

The Italian Social Movement (*Movimento Social Italiano*, MSI) was the
successor party of the deposed government of Benito Mussolini. For
decades after the Second World War it identified itself as a fascist
party and was therefore relegated to political "ghetto" by the other
parties who considered right wing politics of any kind toxic (Newell
2000, 469). After the 1992 *Tangentopoli* scandal exposed corruption
within the political system and led to institutional changes to the
Italian electoral system which gave more power to minor parties, the
party gradually came "in from the cold" and changed its name to the
National Alliance (*Alleanza Nazionale*, NA) in 1995. Under the
leadership of Gianfranco Fini, the NA joined in a long-time "pole of
freedom" coalition partnership with Forza Italia, and the two parties
eventually merged to create the "People of Freedom" (*Popoli della
Libertà*, PDL) party.

The party clearly changed as it re-entered the political system in the
mid-1990s. However the precise dates of this change as they would
reflect inclusion and coding in this dataset are difficult to determine.
From around the time of the 1994 election (and name change) the
leadership made clear statements in support of democratic institutions
and disavowed many racist and anti-Semitic traditions of the far right.
Thereafter many of the party's fascist hard-core split off into the
*Fiamma Tricolore* (Newell 2000, 480--82). Ignazi, while sceptical that
this initial shift was often ambiguous and hollow, agrees that at least
by the late 1990s the party leadership was "progressively and
unambiguously leaving the territory of right-extremism" with statements
of support for democratic institutions and critiques of fascism
(although the party's cadres and members did not always follow) (Ignazi
2004, 148--52). There is general agreement that by the end of the 1990s
the party should not be considered "neo-populist" (Tarchi 2003, 174) or
"anti-system" (Newell 2000, 484), and Ruzza and Fella actually regard
the Fini's participation in the post 2001 Berlusconi coalition
government as a contrast to the other leaders (Berlusconi and Bossi) for
his more moderate and constitutionally respectful leadership (Ruzza and
Fella 2011, 159; see also Zaslove 2011, 63). In a way it seems that the
party's determination to detoxify itself saw it give up its far-right
base right when the Lega Nord was ready to take it (Ignazi 2005, see).
Tarchi notes that it was "one of the first preoccupations" of the NA
leadership to reduce its anti-system character (Tarchi 2003, 139, 173;
see also 2008, 90), even if early documents maintained the party's
opposition to the "partitocrazia" in Rome.

Given that this shift was evidently gradual, and may have occurred more
in official discourse than other forms of discourse (see Tarchi 2003),
it is certainly debatable whether and when the NA should be included.
We've excluded it after its name change, but it may be the case that the
NA's early elections -- especially 1994 -- warrant inclusion for the
continuation of anti-system populist rhetoric. This should be further
researched.

While some comparativists are hesitant to consider the Almirante-led
post-fascist MSI as populist (Kitschelt and McGann 1997), in 1980s the
MSI adopted an image of a "party of protest" (Zaslove 2011, 63; Ignazi
1993, 84), embracing its isolation as an "anti-system" movement against
the corruption of the other parties (the *partitocrazia*) (Newell 2000,
473--74; Fella and Ruzza 2006, 180; Ruzza and Fella 2011, 168; Tarchi
2003, 157; Caciagli 1988, 29) (OTH_POLCLASS = 3). While staunchly
anti-communist, the MSI also maintained some anti-capitalist themes
consistent with fascist ideology (Furlong 1992, 352). However we've not
seen evidence that this should register on the OTH_FINANCIAL variable (=
1).

Despite being clearly extreme-right on the ideological spectrum
(LRPOSITION = FR), in the 1980s and early 1990s the MSI did not seem to
exhibit many of the ideological traits of the European populist right,
many of which would be manifest in the Lega Nord. While exhibiting a
clear sense of nationalism, the party did not focus on foreign "others"
in its political discourse. Tarchi claims that despite a general
anti-Americanism among the party's base, the MSI was not particularly
focused on foreign entities (Tarchi 2003, 165). It was also unopposed to
European integration (Caciagli 1988, 28; Tarchi 2003, 165) or mildly
sceptical (Kritzinger, Cavatorta, and Chari 2004, 958) of EU integration
OTH_FOREIGN = 1. Its approach to ethnic others was also complicated.
While the party had ideological to the ethnocentric narratives of
fascism, it also included wings that emphasised Italy's links with the
Third World in cause of anti-capitalism (Furlong 1992, 352). It did
include a strain of anti-Semitism under Almirante's leadership (Parlato
2017, 53), and therefore deserves 2 on OTH_ETHNIC. According to Ignazi,
in the 1980s when immigration first became a significant issue in
Italian politics, MSI saw this as the consequence of capitalist
domination of the Third World, and avoided demonising immigrants
themselves (although Ignazi says that party cadres and members didn't
necessarily follow this view) (Ignazi 2004, 151; see also Zaslove 2011).
Again, this was an issue-space that seemed to be taken by the Lega Nord
in the 1980s.

Parlato states that the party was "strongly anchored to the charismatic
role of Almirante" (Parlato 2017, 53; see also Caciagli 1988, 32),
although given the party had a firm institutional base of its own
(Ignazi and Ysmal 1992, 102) it should only be coded 2 on CHARISMA under
his leadership. Once Fini took over in 1991, the party should not be
considered leader-defined at all (= 1). MSI had "built into its genetic
code" an opposition to the liberal democratic institutions that had seen
the demise of the Fascist state (Newell 2000, 469; see also Tarchi 2003,
157), and had historical links to violent extremism going back to the
post-war era (Caciagli 1988, 30; Furlong 1992, 348; Ignazi 1993, 83)
(LIBDEMNORMS = 3). Although several party members had ties to the
inter-war fascist regime, by the 1980s this could hardly be said to
count towards any try INSIDER status (= 1).

## Forza Italia

*Forza Italia* (Let's Go Italy, FI) is the party of Milanese Prime
Minister Silvio Berlusconi. Berlusconi is a billionaire media magnate
famous before his entry into politics for his ownership of multiple
private TV stations and the AC Milan football club. FI's entry into
Italian politics occupied the space left by the collapsing Cristian
Democrats in the early 1990s, and after a strong performance in its
debut election in 1994 FI formed a short-lived government with the NA
and LN. With these coalition allies (although intermittently with LN)
Berlusconi was Prime Minister between 1994-95, 2001-2006, and 2008-2011,
alternating mainly with centre left rivals. Forza Italia merged with the
National Alliance (formerly the populist MSI) in 2009, creating the
"People of Freedom" (*Popoli della Libertà*, PDL). As this party was
still led by Berlusconi and the FI rank and file constituted the bulk of
its members and voters (McDonnell, 2013), we have characterised the PDL
as a continuation of FI rather than a new party.

Berlusconi's entrance into Italian politics came at a point when trust
in established parties and politicians was at an all-time low due to the
*Tangentopoli* corruption scandal. Due to this context, he built his
political brand on a distinctly "anti-politics" (Ruzza and Fella 2011,
166; Tarchi 2008, 86; Pasquino 2007; Raniolo 2006, 437; Fella and Ruzza
2013, 39) populism that presented himself as a reluctant saviour of the
people against the "old politics" of the other parties (Tarchi 2008, 86;
Hopkin and Paolucci 1999, 325) and the "political elites" (Fella and
Ruzza 2013, 40) (OTH_POLCLASS = 3). Although he occasionally attacked
big business (Ignazi 2005, 335), Berlusconi and FI were thoroughly
neoliberal and pro-entrepreneur (Ruzza and Fella 2011, 168), advocating
lower taxes and constantly accusing the incompetent political class of
meddling in the private sector's affairs (Tarchi 2008, 96). A big part
of Berlusconi's own identity is of the self-made billionaire
(OTH_FINANCIAL = 1).

While a Eurosceptic attitude has always been present in FI (Raniolo
2006, 442), it is not clear that this or any other foreign foe reached
the level of "other" to the "people" in the party's populist rhetoric
(OTH_FOREIGN = 1), which was one of the main differences between FI and
its coalition partner LN. Another was its less ethnocentric approach to
defining "the people" (Ruzza and Fella 2011, 166; Tarchi 2008, 85--86)
(OTH_ETHNIC = 1). Berlusconi's immigration politics is a little bit more
difficult. While his government introduced controversial legislation
restricting immigration (Geddes 2008), this was attributed more to FI's
coalition partners (LN and NA), and it is not clear in the literature
that anti-immigrant discourse was an important party of the party's
campaigns (OTH_IMMIGRANTS = 1). This should be confirmed.

While the coalition governments led by Berlusconi are considered "right"
(an important term in Italy given its association with fascism since the
war), he and FI are universally considered "centre-right" in the
literature for their moderate conservatism (Sapelli 1997, 179; Tarchi
2008, 84; Ignazi 2004, 147; Zaslove 2011, 61; D'Alimonte 2019, 122;
Verbeek and Zaslove 2015, 306) (LRPOSITION = CR). FI was, especially
early on, dependent on the personality of Berlusconi (Hopkin and
Paolucci 1999, 324; Raniolo 2006; Ignazi 2004, 147; 2005, 335; Ruzza and
Fella 2011, 166; Tarchi 2008, 86; McDonnell 2013, 220), who presented
himself as a savour of Italy unconnected with the establishment (Zaslove
2011, 61). McDonnell suggests that this has continued under the PDL
(McDonnell 2013). While FI it was originally little more than an arm of
Berlusconi's business interests (Hopkin and Paolucci 1999, 321), several
scholars claim that the party attempted to become more institutionalised
and less leader-dependent in the late 1990s (Zaslove 2011, 61; Raniolo
2006, 441). This however this is not enough to reduce the CHARISMA
coding of FI down from 3 for its duration.

Berlusconi build a "politics of doing" to contrast the accused "politics
of chatting" of the political class (Fella and Ruzza 2013, 40), which
involved pushing back against state institutions that checked on
executive power. From 1994, the judiciary in particular was constantly
accused of being partisan, corrupt and inefficient (Ignazi 2005, 335;
Tarchi 2008, 95; Verbeek and Zaslove 2016, 306). Berlusconi's ownership
of such a large section of the media (in addition to his hostility to
critical media) also constituted a threat to media freedom vis-à-vis the
government (Statham 1996, 91). This is enough to consider FI/PDL a mild
threat to liberal democratic norms, even if not an outright threat to
democracy (LIBDEMNORMS = 2). While Berlusconi was very well-connected to
the previous governments, he had no actual politics experience, and
therefore is coded as 1 on INSIDER in 1994, and 3 afterwards.

## Lega Nord / Lega

*Lega Nord* (Northern League, LN) was founded in the 1991 out of a
number of regional "lega\'s" in northern Italy advocating for more
political autonomy from Rome. For most of its life it has been led and
dominated by founder Umberto Bossi. The party drifted in and out of
partnership with *Forza Italia* in the 1990s -- initially standing
together in the breakthrough 1994 election, then bitterly falling out
with Berlusconi after a few months in office, before re-joining in 2001.
It has for most of its life advocated for federalism (even secessionism)
to protect the "Padania" northern region. In 2013 LN was taken over by
Mateo Salvini, and its identity shifted away from its regionalist
origins and toward a more national and non-secessionist profile -- as
evidenced by its dropping the "*Nord*" from its name to become simply
the "*Lega*" before the 2018 elections.

Alongside its demand for regional autonomy in the late 1980s, the
original LN developed a populist opposition to the dominant political
parties in Rome who formed a *cordon sanitaire* against several of the
Lega's early elections. Bossi railed against the incompetence and
corruption of the "patrtitocrazia" in Rome (Gilbert 1993, 100;
Albertazzi, Giovannini, and Seddone 2018, 648; Ignazi 2004, 153; 2005,
345; Fella and Ruzza 2006, 180; Ruzza and Fella 2011, 165), in part
riding a wave of anti-establishment sentiment after the corruption
scandals of the late 1980s (see Tarchi 2008). In Ignazi's words: "the
Lega offered itself to the northern 'honest and laborious' people as a
sanctuary from the sleaze, corruption and selfishness of the traditional
parties and politics" (Ignazi 2005, 345). Although Salvini shifted the
geography of the "elite" from Rome to include Brussels (Vampa 2017, 34),
this anti-political class rhetoric has continued under his leadership
(OTH_POLCLASS = 3).

The Lega's early platform of regional autonomy was rooted in both the
ideology of devolution and a hostility to non-northern cultural/ethnic
others: initially Southern Italian immigrants to the North and later
immigrants from developing countries, in particular North Africa (Betz
1994, 122--23; Ignazi 2004, 153; Fella and Ruzza 2006, 180; Ruzza and
Fella 2011, 165; Zaslove 2011, 57; Furlong 1992, 354). While Betz
mentions that Bossi and the party attempted to moderate xenophobic
rhetoric in the early 1990s, there was clearly enough explicit
anti-Islamic and anti-African discourse in the party to warrant 3 on
both OTH_IMMIGRANTS and OTH_ETHNIC in the 1990s under his leadership
(Giordano 2004, 69; Woods 1992, 60; Ignazi 2004, 154; Tarchi 2008, 85;
Fremeaux and Albertazzi 2002, 154; McDonnell 2006, 129). Under Salvini
this has continued

There are a number of relevant points regarding OTH_FOREIGN. Under Bossi
the Lega "ferociously criticised" the USA for its financial capitalism
and pro-globalisation imperialism. However after 9/11 this subsided as
Islam became a more important threat and the USA an ally (Ignazi 2004,
155; see also Verbeek and Zaslove 2015, 533). Interestingly the party
was very pro-European as it considered the EU as advantageous to
regional safeguards (Verbeek and Zaslove 2015, 531--32), before turning
sharply Eurosceptic from 1998 (Kritzinger, Cavatorta, and Chari 2004,
958; McDonnell 2006, 128--29). It is difficult to pinpoint exactly when
anti-EU rhetoric reached the point of a 3 on our coding scheme, but
Giodano suggests the 2001 election as the best candidate (Giordano 2004,
73). For this reason the party's OTH_FOREIGN coding elevates from 2 to 3
in that year. Under Salvini, hostility to the EU has grown to become an
even stronger component of the Lega's populist discourse (Vampa 2017;
Brunazzo and Gilbert 2017, 625), which it now accused of being
"totalitarian" (Albertazzi, Giovannini, and Seddone 2018).

While the party under Bossi had a low-tax liberal economic outlook that
valorised small businesses and small entrepreneurs (Bull and Gilbert
2001, 90; Zaslove 2011, 57), there are some scholars who claim that this
included attacks on big business, banks and capital who stood in the way
of the small northern producer (Tarchi 2008, 90--91; Biorcio 2003,
72--73; Bull and Gilbert 2001; McDonnell 2006, 128). This seems
sufficient to code LN 2 on OTH_FINANCIAL under Bossi's leadership, but
as sources on Salvini's leaderhip make no mention of this, we have
dropped this down to 1 from 2013.

Ignazi suggests that the early LN should be considered somewhat centrist
(Ignazi 2004, 153--54; see also Verbeek and Zaslove 2016, 306). However
the bulk of the literature identifies it as far right from its inception
(LRPOSITION = FR). Bossi's charismatic and "demagogic" leadership
defined the party (Fella and Ruzza 2006, 180; Ruzza and Fella 2011, 159;
Gilbert 1993, 100; Ignazi 2004, 153; Tarchi 2008, 90; McDonnell 2016),
speaking with a "language that was clear, practical, evoking the
everyday life of ordinary people" (Biorcio 2003, 84; see also McCarthy
1997, 343; Fremeaux and Albertazzi 2002, 150) and possessing an "uncanny
ability to mobilise voters" (Zaslove 2011, 58). According to McDonnell,
Bossi is held "held to possess extraordinary personal qualities and a
*fiuto politico* (political sixth sense) which put his actions and
U-turns beyond reproach" (McDonnell 2006, 130). The party\'s
leader-dependence is equally true under the personal leadership of
Salvini as it was under Bossi (Albertazzi, Giovannini, and Seddone 2018,
651), when charismatic leadership was necessary to overcome the
contradictions of the party's expansion into the south. However the
party has become more institutionalised over time (McDonnell and Vampa
2016), and after Bossi stepped down in 2008 it seems more worthy of
being coded 2 on CHARISMA (3 before this).

According to Ignazi (Ignazi 2004, 154--55), the Lega has a history of
violent party propaganda, the denegration of rules and institutions the
hinder the people's will, and even a paramilitary of sorts in the
*Camicie Verdi* ("green shirts") who staged mass ritual events and
"Padana Patrols" (Biorcio 2003, 90). *Lega* members and leaders have
occasionally used violent rhetoric to discuss its political rivals and
immigrants, but there is not quite enough evidence of this to elevate it
above a 2 on LIBDEMNORMS by the standards of other parties so coded. As
the party participated briefly in the post 1994 Berlusconi government,
it is coded 2 on INSIDER since that election. However as Salvini had no
part in that government, we've taken it back down to 1 after he took
control of the party.

## Five Star Movement

The Five Star Movement, (*Movimento 5 Stella*, M5S or FSM) is the
creation of comedian Beppe Grillo. Grillo had commentated on politics
since the 1970s, and was noted for his sharp attack on ruling
politicians (Cremonesi 2017, 253). He became something of an underground
figure after being kicked off public television in the 1980s for being
too critical of Socialist Prime Minister Bettino Craxi, and in 2005 he
formed a highly successful political blog (Bortoluzzi and Semino 2016).
His informal following grew into a movement via both performances and
online organisation. Starting around 2007 Grillo -- by all accounts an
"explosive speaker" (Ruggiero 2012, 317) -- held a series of "V-Day"
rallies (unofficially *vaffanculo,* "fuck off") that attracted large
audiences in town squares (Tronconi 2018, 164). Simultaneously, his blog
readership was transformed into a sophisticated platform for polling
members on policy stances via the new "Rousseau" software and linking
members with each other via the "Meetup" website. FSM started to run
candidates in 2010, and broke out in the 2013 general elections to
become the most voted party with 25.5%. After years of resolutely ruling
out any form of coalition with other parties, its increased success in
the 2018 election (32%) led to a "populist coalition" with the far-right
Lega, and after the collapse of that coalition in 2019, with the
Democratic Party.

M5S's most important "other" is the political class, namely the
established parties, which it described as one of two "castes" ruling
the country unaccountably (the other being the media) (Bordignon and
Ceccarini 2015, 455; Mosca 2014, 42). As an "anti-political" (Fella and
Ruzza 2013, 39; Maggini 2013, 2), "anti-establishment" (Mosca 2014, 44)
and "anti-system" (Fabbrini and Lazar 2013, 110) movement, it considered
all the parties to be essentially the same (Bortoluzzi and Semino 2016,
2), and ran on slogans like "all politicians have to go home" and "all
professional politicians are corrupt" (Hartleb 2013, 139). Considering
itself a "free association of citizens" rather than a political party
(Lanzone 2014, 68; Cosenza 2014, 90), Grillo considered political
parties and representative democracy itself were dead as instruments for
serving citizens' interests, and that MPs should merely be passive
servants of the people's demands (Diamanti 2014, 4). In his words, "We
want 100% of Parliament, not 20% or 25% or 30%. When the movement gets
to 100%, when the citizens become the state, the movement will no longer
need to exist" (Manucci and Amsler 2018, 18). Eschewing any form of
ideological pedigree, he therefore chose politicians on the basis of
their ordinariness rather than any kind of political experience or
leadership (Bordignon and Ceccarini 2015, 458). In campaigns, Grillo
also used his considerable rhetorical skill to personally demean leaders
of other parties (Bortoluzzi and Semino 2016; Franzosi, Marone, and
Salvati 2015, 110), including their private lives (Hartleb 2013, 139),
and maintained this high level of antagonism after forming government
(Corso 2019, 463). All of this clearly warrants 3 for OTH_POLCLASS.

Aside from this very consistent opposition to the political class, the
ideological and programmatic profile of the M5S is extremely difficult
to pinpoint. A number of analyses suggest that the movement is somewhat
left wing (Hartleb 2013, 139; Mudde 2016, 15) or "left libertarian"
(Verbeek and Zaslove 2016, 307), which may be due to Grillo's initial
focus on environmentalism and sustainability, the movement's linkages
with the anti-globalisation discourses of the early 2000s, and the fact
that many of its initial members were members of left wing associations
(Manucci and Amsler 2018, 7). However the majority of scholars consider
the movement more difficult to categorise, describing its ideology as
"catch all" (Mosca 2014, 46), "post-ideological" (Maggini 2013, 7;
Manucci and Amsler 2018), "eclectic" (Mosca and Tronconi 2019), out of
the left-right dimension" (Chiaramonte et al. 2018, 482). Grillo himself
has described the movement as "beyond" the categories of left and right
(Bordignon and Ceccarini 2015, 460; Bortoluzzi and Semino 2016, 3). This
difficulty is in part due to Grillo's focus on somewhat technical and
"post-material" issues like transport, water, and internet access
(Cremonesi 2017, 254; Corso 2019, 469), but also due to the seemingly
contradictory nature of its policy stances on traditionally contentious
matters. On economic matters for example, Grillo and the party have
advocated some left-leaning policies in favour of state intervention and
a universal income and opposition to austerity, but simultaneously taken
an anti-tax line that comes close to defending tax evasion (Mosca and
Tronconi 2019, 1276; Bordignon and Ceccarini 2015, 460). The party shows
similar ambivalence to immigration and Europe (see below). Manucci and
Amsler, who have focused directly on the movements' ideological profile,
define it as a "'purely populist' party because it has no thick
ideologies attached to its thin ideological core" (Manucci and Amsler
2018, 3). With this in mind, the party is categorised as C on
LRPOSITION.

This ideological and policy ambiguity makes its opposition to "others"
aside from politicians equally difficult to determine. Occasionally
Grillo's rhetoric has targeted "global financial powers" (Miconi 2015,
1044) and the national telecommunications company Telecom (Manucci and
Amsler 2018, 7) and "some expressions of economic oligarchy" (Lanzone
2014, 62), but on the whole these groups only seem relevant when they
relate to the Italian political class's corruption, and it does not
appear that the movement's discourse should register on the
OTH_FINANCIAL scale (= 1).

Likewise, the party's position on OTH_IMMIGRANTS is difficult. Early on
the party completely avoided the sensitive subject (Mosca 2014, 47;
Turner 2013, 206; Mosca and Tronconi 2019, 1277)(Mosca, 2014:47; Turner,
2013:206; Mosca & Tronconi, 2019:1277), but according to D'Alimonte when
Salvini started to voice strong anti-immigrant sentiment in the 2018
election Grillo "followed suit" (D'Alimonte 2019, 117). Other scholars
have noted that the Grillo and the party have occasionally veered toward
anti-immigrant policies (Bordignon and Ceccarini 2015, 460). However
this does not necessarily mean that immigrants are an "other" to the
party's version of the people, something that is captured best by Bulli
and Soare:

> the M5S's stances on immigration are essentially filtered by their
> emphasis on the people's will. There is no a priori exclusion either
> in terms of welfare chauvinism or in terms of a cultural or religious
> threat. It is mainly the denunciation of the way immigration is
> managed by the corrupt national elites and/or the technocratic elites
> in Brussels that characterises the M5S discourse (Bulli and Soare
> 2018, 149).

This makes it difficult to categorise the party as anything other than a
1 on OTH_IMMIGRANTS. OTH_ETHNIC is easier to code (=1), given that all
scholars agree that ethnic identity and xenophobia does not play a part
in the Movement's discourse (Corso 2019, 464; Lanzone 2014, 63; Mosca
and Tronconi 2019, 1277). There is also no evidence to suggest
OTH_MILITARY populism (= 1)

The party's attitude to Europe is also very murky, and has been the
subject of much debate in the literature (Cremonesi 2017, 257). Like on
other matters, Grillo initially avoided taking a stance on Europe (Mosca
2014, 47), and has always tried to have it both ways (Franzosi, Marone,
and Salvati 2015, 113). Similar to immigration, Grillo's criticism of
Brussels often seems to be filtered through his opposition to the
Italian political class; for example by criticising Europe for funding
Italian politicians and excusing their corruption (Corbetta and Vignati
2014, 56--57). Grillo has called for a referendum on the Euro, and his
speeches suggest he is opposed to the currency (Corbetta and Vignati
2014, 58). While this is not OTH_FOREIGN populism *per se*, several
scholars point out that since the 2014 European elections, Grillo and
the party have taken a harsher line against European elites. Franzosi,
Marone and Salvati claim that the party represented Prime Minister Mateo
Renzi as "an agent of German interests in Italy", and that members
sometimes lashed out at the "brussels caste" in a similar way as they
did against the Italian establishment (Franzosi, Marone, and Salvati
2015, 116). While this a difficult call, we've decided to code 2 for
OTH-FOREIGN in 2018 (1 for 2013).

All analysis suggests that Grillo is central to the movement's meaning
and identity (Bentivegna 2014; Lanzone 2014; Mosca 2014, 43), and FSM
has been called a "personal party" (Bordignon and Ceccarini 2015, 465)
and a "one man show" (Hartleb 2013, 140). Grillo has often been accused
of authoritarian management of the movement (Hartleb 2013, 139), and
some members have been thrown out for voicing these concerns (Bordignon
and Ceccarini 2015, 458; Bortoluzzi and Semino 2016, 3). He personally
appoints all of the party's representatives (Miconi 2015), and the
Movement's formal documents certify that he is the sole "guarantor" of
the party's brand (Cosenza 2014, 90). While some question the degree to
which it can be called a personal party due to its usage of
participatory polling to make policy decisions (Diamanti 2014, 4;
Tronconi 2018, 176), in practice these grass roots instruments seem to
be "relegated to a marginal role and employed only when compatible with
the directions from above" (Manucci and Amsler 2018, 5). Hence the
coding of 3 for CHARISMA seems to be clear.

Having never held any national political office, Grillo and M5S are
clearly not INSIDERs (=1). Grillo's vitriolic attacks on the media
(Cosenza 2014, 90; Bordignon and Ceccarini 2015, 463), which he has
called the other "*casta*" alongside politicians (Cremonesi 2017, 256),
don't quite rise to the point of threatening liberal democratic norms,
and the party does not show any contempt for the rule of law or the
judiciary (Corso 2019, 463) (LIBDEMNORMS =1).
