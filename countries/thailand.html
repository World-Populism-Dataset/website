<p>Thailand has had a patchy history of democratization, with numerous democratic constitutions and elections overturned by military coups. After reading some literature on the 1990s period of “semi-democracy” (in which the army controlled the executive but allowed legislative elections), it was concluded that these elections should be included – although no party from this era seemed to be sufficiently populist to warrant inclusion in the dataset.</p>
<section id="thaksin-shinawatra-thai-rak-thai-phak-phalang-prachachon-pheu-thai" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="thaksin-shinawatra-thai-rak-thai-phak-phalang-prachachon-pheu-thai">Thaksin Shinawatra, Thai Rak Thai, Phak Phalang Prachachon, Pheu Thai</h2>
<p>Thai Rak Thai (“Thais Love Thailand”, TRT) was the political party of Thaksin Shinawatra. A telecommunications entrepreneur from Chang Mai, Thaksin was the country’s richest man in the 1990s when he served briefly in two governments as Foreign Minister (1994-95) and twice as Deputy Prime Minister (1996, 1997). Following the severe economic downturn following the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, Thaksin founded TRT to contest in the 2001 election. After landslide victories in that election and again in 2005, a boycotted 2006 poll was overturned by the courts, leading to a crisis which ended up in Thaksin’s overthrow by the military in September 2006 and the banning of TRT.</p>
<p>After his ouster, the exiled Thaksin has been heavily involved in two successor parties that subsequently won national elections in 2007 and 2011 – the Phak Phalang Prachachon (“People’s Power Party”, PPP) and Pheu Thai (“People’s Party”, PT), respectively. Both parties were/are officially led by Thaksin’s inner-circle loyalists and family members, leading both to be widely seen in the literature as TRT by another name (see: Pongsudhirak. 2008:49; McCargo, 2008:340; Chen, 2014a:157; Sawasdee, 2019:103). These parties are also seen to be closely related to the pro-Thaksin and anti-coup “red-shirt” movement (contra to the anti-Thaksin “yellow shirt” movement that had demonstrated in 2005-2008) that blossomed in Bangkok after the PPP government was ousted in a “judicial coup” of 2008 (Sinpeng &amp; Kuhonta, 2012:397).</p>
<p>While Thaksin is universally called a populist in the Thai studies literature, this literature is challenging for two reasons. First the term “populism” is almost always used in the programmatic sense to describe social democratic policies “popular” among the rural poor – not populist political rhetoric <em>per se</em> (see Hewison, 2017; Hawkins &amp; Selway, 2017). Hence the universal characterisation of TRT as a populist party in the 2001 election has more to do with its policies of subsidising health care, forgiving agricultural loans, and providing village level microfinance than any hostility to an “elite”. TRT’s 2001 campaign was also the first in which this kind of national policy had been the centrepiece of a campaign, as opposed to elite alliance-building reliant on local political bosses to drive turnout in the countryside (Pasuk &amp; Baker, 2002:3; Choi, 2005:51) – something that is also probably relevant to its “populist” categorisation in the literature. Second, while there is literature that discusses the rhetorical form of the term, this tends to have an abstract evidence base that rarely quotes Thaksin, other party leaders, or campaign slogans.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there are enough exceptions to this rule to study TRT’s potential populism in sufficient detail. This evidence suggests that the party’s initial election in 2001, while based on some anti-corruption platforms and a vaguely economic-nationalist (anti-IMF) reaction to the 1997 crisis, did not include any fundamental anti-elite populist narratives and should not be included in this dataset (see Pasuk &amp; Baker, 2008:65; Hewison, 2010:121; Hawkins and Selway, 2017:384; Hewison, 2017:432; Thompson, 2012:68). Exactly when TRT and successor parties transitioned to an anti-elite populist discourse is debated in the literature. Pasuk and Baker (2004) suggest Thaksin’s reaction to the 2001 constitutional court case in which he was accused of violating asset disclosure rules while a minister in the 1990s. When awaiting the verdict, he publicly described the court case as a conspiracy of the ruling elite against him and “the people” who elected him, and that he would chose loyalty to the people over loyalty to the court (Pasuk, 2004:5; see also Case, 2007:632).</p>
<p>In the years following, he further honed a discourse that (ubiquitously) valorised the people and (more rarely) contrasted them to an elite establishment of “old politics” (Pasuk &amp; Baker, 2008:79-80; see also Markou and Phanuwat, 2015:5; Jayasuria &amp; Hewison, 2004:585; Norton, 2012:49; Pasuk &amp; Baker, 2013:609-10). In one speech in 2002 Thaksin claimed that the government authority in Thailand had been abused to “serve the interests of those in power… Governments have enacted laws to sustain their own power rather than to empower the people who put them in office” (Pasuk &amp; Baker, 2004:8). In a typically populist understanding of “the people”, he continued that ideology should play no role in modern parties, who should simply decide what to do based on “the needs and desires of the people.” (Pasuk &amp; Baker, 2004:8). According to Hewison, (2017:434; see also Thompson, 2012:68) during the yellow-shirt demonstrations (after the 2005 election) Thaksin’s speeches “increasingly linked himself to his supporters and declared them a democratic bedrock against elite-controlled authoritarianism. Thaksin had identified an ‘other’; the Bangkok-centred elite.”</p>
<p>After the 2006 coup, any vagueness regarding the people’s enemy disappeared in Thaksin’s political discourse, as he adopted the “full throated populism” against his elite rivals that he had been hesitant to use earlier (Hewison, 2017:427). For example, in one speech he claimed that “democracy was only for the elite. But now, people have filled their stomachs. And they want more. But the elite don’t want change that will affect their already happy lives” (Hewison, 2017:436). This anti-elite rhetoric has been evident in the red-shirt protests (UDD) that started in 2008 (note that it is generally accepted in the literature that red-shirts and pro-Thaksin parties – particularly Pheu Thai – are fused entities, see Sinpeng &amp; Kuhonta, 2012; Sinpeng, 2014). In one speech Thaksin referred to a “power beyond the constitution” and an “invisible hand” as responsible for his overthrough (Thongchai, 2014:96, 104), following which the term “<em>ammat</em>” (or alternatively, “<em>aphichon</em>”) entered political discourse in reference to the aristocratic elite – i.e.&nbsp;the military, privy councillors, the democratic party, yellow-shirt protest leaders, and arguably (and controversially) the monarchy (Sinpeng &amp; Kuhonta, 2012: 411; Prapart, 2011:2-3; Nelson, 2012:17; Chairat, 2013:206). <em>Ammat</em> is juxtaposed against the <em>prai/phrai</em> (“people”) who back Thaksin and his parties.</p>
<p>Thaksin is therefore another case in which OTH_POLCLASS rhetoric clearly rose from a small base, but where it is difficult to pin this down to clear points in time. Following the literature, I’ve coded TRT 2 for the 2005 election, and PPP &amp; PT 3 after the 2006 coup (2007 and 2011 elections), although there may be a case to code 3 in 2005. Likewise, there is no evidence of anti-military rhetoric from Thaksin until after the 2006 coup (Connors, 2005:366; Chairat, 2013:206), after which this became a sustained element of his populism (OTH_MILITARY = 1 in 2005, =3 2007-11).</p>
<p>It is often suggested that there were nationalistic elements to Thaksin’s politics, particularly relating to the fallout from the Asian Financial Crisis and the counter-IMF common at the time (Glassman, 2004; Jayasuria &amp; Hewison, 2004; McCargo &amp; Pathmanand, U 2005:5; Somchai, 2008:108; Pye &amp; Schaffar, 2008:46). As PM he also occasionally clashed with foreign funded NGOs and the foreign press, considering them both to be threats to “Thai sovereignty” (Pasuk &amp; Baker, 2004:17-18; see also Pasuk, 2004:4). This however only seems to be a mild form of OTH_FOREIGN rhetoric rather than a core element of Thaksin’s populist discourse, and one that disappeared after the 2006 coup, when foreign powers do not seem very relevant to Thaksin/red shirt populist narrative (=2 in 2005, =1 2007- ). As the country’s richest man, he also did not present any OTH_FINANCIAL populism – on the contrary he promoted entrepreneurialism among the Thai population and claimed that his business expertise was the basis of his governing ability (=1).</p>
<p>There is also no evidence of OTH_ETHNIC populism. In fact Thaksin and many members of his government were from the minority Chinese community – an economically powerful community that had been somewhat political marginalised, and the TRT era is considered by some to have reduced this marginalisation and produced more acceptance of Chinese-Thai culture and politicians (Pasuk &amp; Baker, 2004:11). In his first term included harsh policies toward refugees and migrants from Myanmar and Cambodia, but there is no evidence that this was a particularly important component of his populist discourse (OTH_IMMIGRANT =1) when it started.</p>
<p>Thaksin is very difficult to categorise on a left-right ideological basis (see: Hewison 2010:120). His most well-known economic policies (see above) are generally socially democratic. However he clearly had a generally neo-liberal view of economic policy and was hostile to bureaucracy and state intervention in general (see Pasuk and Baker, 2008:64). He occasionally claimed that he was applying a “dual track” economic policy of socialism and capitalism in equal measure (Ungpakorn, 2007:16; Pasuk and Baker, 2004:10). Given his core economic philosophy was more neo-liberal than leftist, I’ve coded him CR on LRPOSITION here – but this could be disputed. There is less debate about the role of charisma in Thaksin’s populism, given that he dominated the identity of his parties to the exclusion of all other senior members, and later incarnations in particular are personality cults around his leadership (see Pasuk &amp; Baker, 2008:69, 76, see also Bo Kyeong Seo, 2019:556; Sawasdee, 2019:112; Thompson, 2012:75; Pasuk and Baker, 2013:610) (CHARISMA = 3). As his first election coded in the dataset is 2005, his incumbency since 2001 gives him 3 on INSIDER. Incidentally, he would have been a 2 in 2001, given that he had served as deputy PM and cabinet minister in the 1990s, and relied on many state connections to develop his business career (Pasuk &amp; Baker, 2002:3; MacCargo, 2002:115).</p>
<p>In government, Thaksin opposed liberal democratic norms in numerous ways (Jayasuria &amp; Hewison, 2004:572; Ferrara, 2015:361). He clashed with many of the oversight authorities which had been set up by the liberal 1997 constitution: questioning the authority of courts and sending emissaries to pressure judges (McCargo &amp; Pathmanand, 2005:16; Pongsudhirak. 2008:54); clamping down on protest rights (Pasuk and Baker, 2004:19-20), taking personal control of the police (Funston 2002:313; Pasuk and Baker, 2004:20), and packing state institutions with family members and demoting politicians who clashed with them (Pasuk and Baker, 2004:12). On several occasions he likened himself to Thai dictators of previous eras (Pasuk and Baker, 2004:70) and articulated an authoritarian vision of centralised power which included no space for political debate – this being redundant given that serving the people was an obvious and uncontentious policy that required no ideological split (Pasuk &amp; Baker, 2004:15; Jayasuria &amp; Hewison, 2004:585). He was particularly hostile to media freedom, using his state and financial power to supress critical coverage of his government (Lee 2014:180, McCargo &amp; Pathmanand, U 2005:193; Pasuk &amp; Baker, 2004:15; Pasuk &amp; Baker, 2008:70; Nelson, 2007:22; Funston 2002:313) and suing individual journalists who provided negative coverage (Pye &amp; Schaffar, 2008:51). Thaksin’s war on drugs in the south of the country was also highly illiberal, including summary executions which he dismissed as “not an unusual fate for wicked people” (Mutebi, 2004:80; see also Connors, 2005:377; Pongsudhirak. 2008: 48). All of this clearly warrants a coding of 3 for LIBDEMNORMS.</p>

<p>The Future Forward (FF) party of young billionaire car parts mogul Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit appeared for the first time in the 2019 election and beat all expectations by winning 18%, mainly among younger and urban voters around Bangkok (Siripan, 2020:65). FF was highly progressive on social issues, and became known for its leader’s confrontational style and opposition to the military junta (McCargo &amp; Saowanee, 2019: 95, 100; Prajak, 2019:164).</p>
<p>This is a debatable inclusion, but on the balance of evidence it does seem that Thanathorn’s discourse against the military and the political establishment did reach the level of populism: In the words of McCargo (2019b:127) “his public criticisms of the military could be bold to the point of unthinkable”, and party activists claimed that the party’s mission was to “oppose hierarchism” (OTH_POLCLASS = 3, OTH_MILITARY = 3). I’ve seen no other evidence of OTH_FINANCIAL, OTH_IMMIGRANT or OTH_ETHNIC (all = 1). All analysis emphasises the central role of Thanathorn’s personality in the party’s performance (McCargo &amp; Saowanee, 2019: 95, 100) (CHARISMA = 3) and there is no evidence of INSIDER (= 1) or LIBDEMNORMS (= 1). Given its characterisation as “progressive” on policy positions (McCargo, 2019a:156) I’ve coded FF CL on LRPOSITION.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="not-included">Not included</h2>
<p>In the early 1990s a division opened up between the pro-and anti-military factions of the political establishment following the 1992 Black May massacre. To figures in the anti-military camp are occasionally considered populist in the literature. General Chavalit Yongchaiyudh’s National Aspiration Party was one of these, and was briefly in power before being thrown out after the 1997 crisis. Chavalit does seem to have a history of anti-elite statements (Neher, 1988:193), but it seems that NAP’s designation as “populist” is usually due to its policies rather than its rhetoric (Okey, 2005:742; Ungpakorn, 2007:112), and there is insufficient evidence that is should be included here. A somewhat stronger case could be made for General Chamlong Srimuang, a moral “puritan” (Chen, 2014b:195) of national politics who led the May 1992 uprising. Chamlong is considered a “populist figure” by some for this reason (McCargo &amp; Parhmanand, 2005:8), but as with Chavalit I’ve not seen enough evidence of genuine populist rhetoric. Chamlong’s <em>Palang Dharma</em> was the party under which Thaksin first entered politics.</p>
