title: United States

One challenge with the United States is that its clear history with
populism is slightly obscured by the embeddedness of its two-party
system. Both parties have traditionally varied greatly from one locality
to another, and ascribing either as fundamentally populist is difficult
-- even are led by presidential candidates who fit the label. Hence, we
have looked only at presidential candidates here.

## Donald Trump

Celebrity businessman and real estate scion Donald Trump ran a populist
campaign for the presidency in 2016, after first successfully seeking
the Republican party's nomination. His campaign centred on a brash
hostility to the political class, an abrasive attitude to his opponents,
an air of national economic and cultural crisis, and a loose ideological
grounding of right-wing nativism and nationalism. Throughout the
campaign Trump built off his well-established brand to court media
attention through controversial statements (Jacobson, 2017:15), and his
clinching of the nomination and presidency -- although neither included
majorities of the vote -- surprised most observers. While Trump can be
placed in a long tradition of American populism (see: Savage, 2019), he
is generally considered to be a departure from the norms of presidential
campaigning in recent generations (Appel, 2018:157). As with some others
in the literature (Fenger, 2018:193; Schneiker, 2020:2) we've elected
not to categorise the whole Republican party as populist in the same
ways as Trump was.

Trump distinguished himself with an uncompromisingly *ad hominin*
rhetoric against his political opponents (Mendes, 2016:65; Appel, 2018;
Nai & Maier, 2018:82) whom he collectivised as a broader "elite"
political "establishment" (Oliver and Rahn, 2016:193; Jensen & Bang,
2017:355). Throughout the 2016 campaign he used the slogan "drain the
swamp" to suggest that the corruption of Washington D.C. had become
entrenched and systemic (Rudolph, 2019:1), suggested that the "system is
rigged against our citizens" in favour of the powerful (Jamieson &
Taussig, 2017:624), and claimed in typically populist terms that on
"every major issue affecting this country, the people are rights and the
governing elite are wrong" (Oliver and Rahn, 2016:189). He pledged to be
the "voice" of the "American people" against this establishment (Ostiguy
& Roberts, 2016:43). In the 2016 election, this antipathy to the
governing elite was trained most directly on opponent Hilary Clinton
(whom he said should be put in prison for corruption, Biegon, 2019:527),
but also against high profile members of his own party, the media and
the state, suggesting a holistically anti-political class discourse
(OTH_POLCLASS = 3).

Antipathy toward immigration on cultural, economic and security grounds
formed a key component of the Trump campaign (Mendes, 2016:65), and was
manifested in his policy to build a wall along the Mexican border and
force Mexico to pay for it. This anti-immigrant sentiment applied to
asylum seekers from Syria, whom he promised to deport if he won (Mendes,
2016:65). He also repeatedly linked the control of immigration with
terrorism (Hall, 2020:5) (OTH_IMMIGRANTS = 3). This anti-immigrant
stance correlated with an ethnocentric rhetoric that demonised Muslims,
Mexicans (seemingly by extension, Latinxs), and other minorities
(Jacobson, 2017:20; Biegon, 2019:523; Savage, 2019:409). A few notable
examples of this discourse were: his claim that the immigrants being
"sent" by Mexico were "bringing crime, they're rapists" at his campaign
commencement speech (Edwards, 2018:185); proposing a ban on Muslims from
entering the country; questioning the qualification of an American-born
judge to preside over his affairs on the basis that "he's a Mexican";
and asserting without evidence the conspiracy theory that Muslim's
cheered when the World Trade Centre was attacked on September 11, 2001
(see: Jamieson & Taussig, 2017; Hall, 2020; Savage, 2019:402). Of
relevance here is his intense media campaign years earlier alleging that
incumbent President Barack Obama (2009-17) was born in Kenya and
ineligible for the presidency -- something many scholars consider a
racist dog whistle given that Obama is African American (Kellner,
2017:81). More broadly, many scholars have also considered Trump
campaign rhetoric to tap into deeper anxieties among white voters (Bobo,
2017; Ostiguy & Roberts, 2016:44). It is debatable whether all of this
should earn Trump a 2 or 3 on our OTH_ETHNIC coding, given that his
ethnocentrism was still somewhat implicit and more opaque than more
outright ethnic majoritarian populist candidates in Europe and
elsewhere. While this could be further discussed, we've coded Trump 2 on
this scale.

Trump is often considered to have upended the Republican party's prior
association with economic liberalism and free trade orthodoxy (Ostiguy &
Roberts, 2016:41), and taken a sharper stance against major American
businesses that sent jobs offshore (Edwards, 2018:182; Schneiker,
2020:3-4). While this is some truth to this, it would be a stretch to
register this rhetoric on the OTH_FINANCIAL variable as he did not
really portray the country's wealthy and business class as the core of
the problem. Claiming to be a billionaire himself, he often praised
loyal businesses and repeated neoliberal mantras about the intrusiveness
of government regulations. In his acceptance speech for the Republican
nomination for example he pledged to make America "rich again using the
greatest business people in the world" (cited in Ostiguy & Roberts,
2016:43). Hence while high profile businesses and wealthy figures may
have occasionally been on Trump's 2016 enemies list, the wealthy did not
constitute a core "other" to the people in his populist discourse. This
remained the case during the first term of the Trump presidency, when
feuds with the likes of Jeff Bezos or the Koch brothers (Boucher and
Thies, 2019:714) (OTH_FINANCIAL=1). In office, Trump has pursued more
neoliberal economic policies than his campaign suggested.

Foreign states played an important role in the Trump campaign's
conceptualisation of the American People's opponents. Trump routinely
claimed that other countries were ripping America off and free-riding on
its generosity (Ostiguy & Roberts, 2016:44). This extended from military
alliances like NATO to trade imbalances with Mexico and China and asylum
seeker resettlement arrangements. At times this formed a general
anti-globalization agenda that pushed back not only on free trade, but
on global institutions and rules (Biegon, 2019:529; Edwards, 2018).
While these foreign and "global" powers were clearly relevant "others"
to Trump's American people, this doesn't quite extend to the point of
local leaders acting on their behalf, and therefore OTH_FOREIGN is coded
2. The military did not feature as an "other" in Trump's rhetoric
(OTH_MILITARY = 1).

While the 2016 campaign pushed back on some economic policies of the
American right (see above), Trump's cultural nativism, nationalism and
underlying neo-liberalism clearly make his campaign right wing
(LRPOSITION = R). Trump's brash persona has undoubtedly been central to
his campaign's appeal (Schneiker, 2020). A key component of this image
has been Trump's willingness to provide an official interpretation of
seemingly every news story and event, often on direct channels like
Twitter and call-ins to news programs, creating a personalised and
centralised source of political information to his supporters. This
occasionally reached comical level when he claimed, for example, that he
knew more about ISIS than "the generals" (Hall, 2020:6). By claiming of
America's crisis that "I alone can fix it" his campaign built a saviour
complex around his personality and leadership (Lieberman *et al*,
2019:2). However as Trump was the nominee of the well-established
Republican Party, he should be coded 2 by the definition of our CHARISMA
variable. While Trump had occasionally donated to politicians of both
parties, he had never served in government in any capacity, and is
therefore coded 1 for INSIDER.

The Trump campaign and presidency have pushed significantly against
liberal democratic norms in several ways (see Lieberman *et al*, 2019).
As a candidate he questioned the integrity of democratic and judicial
institutions, official government statistics on matters areas like
labour and immigration, and the impartiality of federal law enforcement
organisations (Jamieson & Taussig, 2017:620, 627). At several of his
campaign rallies he encouraged supporters to assault protesters (Mendes,
2016:66; Ostiguy & Roberts, 2016:44), and in the words of Mendes
(2016:66) "\[h\]e seems perfectly willing to countenance illegal acts
and abandon due process to combat the threats he invokes." He has been
extremely hostile to media criticism, and declared that the media was
the "enemy of the American people" (Jamieson & Taussig, 2017:638). As
with OTH_ETHNIC, the LDNORMS scale is difficult with Trump, because
there's a good case for him to be coded either 2 or 3. While this could
be further debated, we've concluded that the above actions shouldn't
quite reach the point of "threatening the democratic order", and hence
he is coded 2.

## Not Included

Billionaire **Ross Perot's** presidential candidacy in 1992 and 1993 is
often considered to be populist, which seems to be for three reasons.
First his rhetoric was explicitly pro-"people" in somewhat populist
terms. In advertisements, interviews and debates, Perot routinely
claimed that ordinary people had been left out of politics, and
contrasted this problem with his own campaign which was driven more by
voluntary engagement rather than the backing of major parties. Take for
example his call to "go back to what this country is supposed to be
about. The voters own this country" (Prendergast, 2008:29). Second,
Perot styled himself as a true outsider to American political incumbents
of both parties, and claimed that his mission as "cleaning out the
political barn" (Prinz, 1994; Broussard, 1995:62). This was coupled with
an anti-politics (Brown, 1997) characterisation Washington as "the
system" without significant differences between the major parties
(Schulte-Sasse, 1993), and hence one with a political class in control.
Third, his appeal (although his campaign was based on highly
programmatic policy proposals about the budget and inequality) was
highly charisma based, and his plain -spoken and folksy persona was
billed as an antidote to a general crisis facing the county's economic
management (Owen & Dennis, 1996:384; Tonn & Endress, 2001:281).

While there is a claim that this constitutes a kind of populism, we find
that his characterisation of the incumbent political order was not
actually populist by our definition, and fits more within the norms of
"outsider" campaigning by major party candidates in American politics,
albeit in a more concentrated form. Perot claimed that he was fighting
the "system" but said the failings of this systems to be flawed ideas,
estrangement from the real issues of everyday people, and dominated by
"paid professionals" (Prendergast, 2008:27). Lacking in this
characterisation of the incumbent order was any accusatory anti-elitism
that suggested the elite was of any kind of ill-character or corruption,
of that the problems of ordinary people were benefiting those
incumbents. In fact, Perot claimed that there was too much negativity in
political campaigning (Prendergast, 2008:27), and suggested that many of
his antagonists in the system were "fine people" (Schulte-Sasse,
1993:95).
