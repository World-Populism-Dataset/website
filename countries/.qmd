subtitle: |2

  Date range: 1980-2020

  Spain transitioned to democracy after dictator Francisco Franco's death
  in 1975. Since the 1980's the party system has been dominated by two
  parties: the Socialist Party (PSOE) and the right-wing Popular Party
  (PP). This "bipartidismo" system suffered a crisis due to the financial
  crisis and the outbreak of numerous corruption scandals. This crisis of
  representation paved the way for the birth of new parties in 2015
  (Podemos and Ciudadanos) and in 2019 (VOX and Más País) as well as the
  nationalist resurgence in Catalonia.

## Podemos/ We Can

Podemos ("We can") originated from of the indignados anti-corruption and
anti-austerity mass protests (Ramiro y Gomez 2017, 111). In 2014, a
group of university lecturers with no previous political experience led
by leftist Pablo Iglesias created the party (INSIDER = 1). As part of
its territorial conception of Spain, Podemos engaged in coalitions
together with other regional parties and developed regional versions of
itself (Rodríguez-Teruel, Barrio, y Barberà 2016). Sometimes, these
regional coalitions ran parallel to Podemos but under a different legal
political organization. For the sake of simplicity and following the
tradition of political analysis in Spain, Podemos and its coalitions are
considered as just one party in the database.

Podemos is a classic case of radical-left populism as recognized by the
literature (Barrio 2017; Briziarelli 2016; Lavezzolo y Ramiro 2018;
Ramiro y Gomez 2017; Zarzalejos 2016). Both Pablo Iglesias and Iñigo
Errejón are academic followers of the work of populist theorists Ernesto
Laclau and Chantal Mouffe and they very explicitly applied their
approach to their political platform (Iglesias 2014). They aim to
substitute the "right vs left" divide for a new divide between "people
vs. elite" (Ramiro y Gomez 2017, 111). They employ the term "la casta"
to refer to political and economic elites (Briziarelli 2016, 292). La
casta is "a fundamental component of the political class that runs the
country. This is people not representing the citizens but butlers of
financial capital. La casta is a minority that rules against the
majority's interests, living in a shameful condition of privilege"
(Iglesias 2014a). Against la casta, Podemos wishes to transform the
country by redrafting the Constitution in order to establish a real
democracy and give power to the people (Briziarelli 2016). As Iglesias
stated:

> There are two groups, the ones above us who live in prosperity and the
> one below. The one below needs to be aware of its condition, otherwise
> we are all screwed. Democracy cannot be exercised only every 4 years,
> with a voting slip \[. . .\] That is not democracy. Democracy depends
> on the people, you, going on the streets defending your political
> power against them. The power is in the people's hands. If we the
> people do not exercise it, they will exercise it for us and there is
> no democracy (Iglesias 2014a)

In addition to identifying political and economic elites as part of la
casta (OTH_POLCLASS and OTH_ECONOMIC = 3), Podemos has also been a harsh
critic of the austerity measures imposed by the EU leaders and has
claimed that Spanish politicians are being controlled by foreign powers.
For instance, on one occasion he said that "Merkel is very happy with
viceroy Mariano Rajoy \[President of Spain at the time\] who does not
obey his citizens but who obeys her. We are going to work to have a
government that represents the interests of the citizens and not those
of a foreign country" (Iglesias 2015) (OTH_FOREIGN = 3).

The party is very inclusive of immigrants within "the people" supporting
universal health coverage for all immigrants and including in their
party lists the first Afro-Spanish women to have a seat in parliament
(Fernández 2015). Moreover, although the party defends a united Spain,
it supports holding a referendum of independence in Catalonia and
changing the constitution in order to declare Spain "plurinational"
(Puente 2016) (OTH_IMMIGRANTS and OTH_ETHNIC = 1).

In relation to the army, although Iglesias declared that "the military
sometimes defends interests they should not defend" he also claimed that
"they are an essential component of a democracy and are needed in order
to defend the independence and social rights of a country" (Iglesias
2014b). Moreover, Podemos included a former Chief of the Defense Staff
among his most prominent electoral candidates (OTH_MILITARY = 1).

Podemos could not have been born without the figure of Pablo Iglesias.
At the time of the creation of the party, he was a well-known TV guest
in political debates and used that popularity in order to launch Podemos
by adding his face to the voting list of the party. However, as the
party has become more institutionalized over the years and has suffered
several divisions within the core group, Iglesias has lost his relevance
in favour of other figures such as Irene Montero. We have therefore
coded 3 on CHARISMA in the 2015 and 2016 elections but only 2 in the
2019 elections.

Although Podemos has been a powerful critic of the Spanish media, the
party has always defended democratic procedures. The party holds
extensive primary elections to select candidates and consults its
members to make important choices such as entering in government
coalitions or not (Monrosi y Ortiz 2023). Podemos also has a strong
anti-corruption program and is highly transparent in its proceedings
(Podemos s. f.). Moreover, in relation to the conflict in Catalonia,
Podemos has always defended dialogue and criticized both the use of
force and the suspension of autonomy of the region (Domínguez y Marcos
2017) (LIBDEMNORMS = 1).

## VOX

VOX was formed in 2014 from former members of the Popular Party who were
dissatisfied with what they perceived as that party's lack of
ideological definition. The party, led by Santiago Abascal, remained
unsuccessful in elections until the 2018 regional elections in
Andalucía, when it entered into the regional parliament and enabled a
Right-wing government for the first time ever in the region. The party
then ran for the 2019 elections in April and again in the repetition of
elections in November. According to Turnbull-Dugarte:

> VOX is a party with a political ideology firmly grounded in
> authoritarian conservatism and nationalism. Far from being a
> single-issue anti-immigrant party (Art, 2011), it advocates policy
> positions including opposition to same-sex marriage, abortion, gender
> quotas, gender violence protection ordinances, and general social
> welfare provision, marking the party's ideological parity with other
> Western European radical right-wing parties (Art, 2011; Mudde, 2004,
> 2007; Norris, 2005). Indeed, its populist approach of promising to
> "make Spain great again" alongside its nativist authoritarianism
> signal its fulfilment of Mudde's (2004) classification as a populist
> radical right party. Of note in the specific case of Vox, however, is
> the addition of a strong anti-feminist message (Simón 2019) brought
> about in response to recent waves of feminist advancement in Spain as
> evidenced by the historical 8M demonstrations in 2018.
> (Turnbull-Dugarte 2019, 2).

In a clear reference to Donald Trump, their 2016 electoral manifesto was
titled "Make Spain great again" (Vox 2016). The main enemy of VOX is the
current politicians of Spain, as it is clearly stated in their website's
self-description:

> VOX \[...\] born to put the institutions at the service of the
> Spanish, in contrast to the current model that puts the Spanish at the
> service of politicians. VOX is the commonsense party, which gives
> voice to what millions of Spaniards think in their homes; the only one
> that fights against suffocating political correctness. In VOX we do
> not tell the Spaniards how they have to think, speak or feel, we tell
> the media and the parties to stop imposing their beliefs on society.
> Our project is summed up in the defense of Spain, of family and of
> life; in reducing the size of the State, guaranteeing equality between
> the Spaniards and expelling the Government from your private life.
> (Vox 2013).

VOX, however, does not extend its criticism of the political elites
(OTH_POLCLASS = 3) to the economic ones. In fact, VOX defends a very
liberal program in economic terms. One of the leaders of VOX said that
"we don't want a large state, the less state, the more freedom for the
citizens" (quoted in Antón-Mellón (2019) and on their website it was
possible to read that VOX "believes in a system based on liberty where
all taxes are as reduced as possible or even eliminated. Less taxes,
more jobs. Less state, more freedom" (quoted in Antón-Mellón (2019)
(OTH_ECONOMIC = 1).

VOX also strongly defends Spanish sovereignty against "globalists" and
criticizes the rest of the parties for following the dictates of the EU
instead of those of the Spanish people (Abascal 2019). Moreover, Abascal
wishes to make Gibraltar part of Spain, attacks the "international
oligarchies" and insults Ciudadanos for being "cosmopaletos" or "stupid
cosmopolitans" (Abascal 2019) (OTH_FOREIGN = 3). Abascal has proposed to
increase the army's budget and has included several soldiers as
candidates of VOX (Araluce 2019) (OTH_MILITARY = 1).

Santiago Abascal was a low-level politician of the Popular Party in the
Basque Country before he decided to leave the party (INSIDER = 1). He
was not well-known outside the Basque Country and he was not even
elected first president of VOX. He assumed the role after the first 2014
disastrous elections and the party became relevant through regional
elections in Andalucía, in which he was not even a candidate. Therefore,
although he is the face of the party, VOX would also have existed
without Abascal and its current popularity can hardly be attributed to
him (CHARISMA = 1).

VOX displays a very strong Spanish nationalism whose main enemy is the
pro-independence parties in Catalonia. VOX proposes not only to
recentralize the state and eliminate all autonomous regions and their
parliaments but also argues for the illegalization of any party that
does not defend the unity of Spain (Vox 2019, 2). Their nationalism is
not only about territorial integrity but has an important ethnic
component as well. VOX stresses the defence of the Spanish language and
wishes to implement a "comprehensive plan for the knowledge,
dissemination and protection of national identity and the contribution
of Spain to civilization and universal history, with special attention
to the deeds and feats of our national heroes" (Vox 2019, 3).

In relation to migration, VOX advocates for the deportation of all
illegal immigrants in Spain and of those that are legally in the
territory but have committed a felony (Vox 2019, 5). The party also
wishes to "stop the invitation effect" (Vox 2019, 5) and has repeatedly
condemned "multiculturalism" (Abascal 2019). This anti-immigrant stance
is particularly harsh against Muslims:

> One of the party's earliest promotional videos was a spoof news
> broadcast depicting a veiled woman reporting from outside the
> mosque-cathedral of Cordoba after an imagined consecration to Islam by
> a fictional left-wing government (the building was erected during
> Spain's Moorish era and was turned into a cathedral in the 13^th^
> century). The video ends with the words: 'Do you want a future like
> this?' and doomy music. (Loucaides 2018).

Thus, we have coded 3 for OTH_ETHNIC and OTH_IMMIGRANTS.

VOX's ethnonationalism and proposals to make illegal all parties that do
not agree with principles in the Constitution (such as the unity of
Spain) are clear violations of existing liberal democratic norms. VOX
also argues for the elimination of the Law against gender violence
present in Spain since 2004 and to eliminate "radical feminist
organisms" (Vox 2019, 17). However, VOX has not incited violence, nor
attacked freedom of the press, nor threatened democratic institutions
beyond its ethnonationalism (LIBDEMNORMS = 2).

## Not included

**Mas País / SUMAR** (More Country) was created from a division within
Unidas Podemos led by Íñigo Errejón, former leader of Podemos. Errejón
created the party Mas Madrid to ran for president of the regional area
of Madrid in April 2019 and, although he was unsuccessful, he decided to
form Mas País in order to compete in the national elections in November
2019. Errejón is a scholar on populism and explicitly employs populist
rhetoric in his politics, however, he wishes to distinguish himself from
the hard-left image of Podemos and he also stresses the green ideology
of the party. The party did not achieve the threshold of 5% of the share
of the vote to be included in the dataset.

**Ciudadanos (Citizens)** was formed in 2006 in Catalonia, and was seen
by many as an alternative to the growing Catalan nationalist movements
-- so much that it was originally seen as a single-issue movement. In
later years it has become something very similar to Macron's En Marche
in France -- a pro-European, liberal, pro-entrepreneur, anti-corruption,
reformist and revival party attracting the attention of the Centre
right. The party has been a critic of "bipartidismo" and of the
corruption affecting PSOE and PP and is entirely dependent on its
charismatic and (very) young leader Albert Rivera.

Nevertheless, the party is not considered populist by any scholar on the
topic (Lluis Orriols y Cordero 2016; Rodon y Hierro 2016;
Rodríguez-Teruel, Barrio, y Barberà 2016). Comparing Podemos and
Citizens, Lavezzolo y Ramiro (2018, 268) argue that "although both
Podemos and Ciudadanos are new parties \[...\] and present themselves as
political reformers in clear contrast to the mainstream parties, Podemos
is a radical-left populist pro-participatory democracy party \[...\]
while Ciudadanos is a centrist one aiming for much more moderate
political reforms". Although the party's success is the result of the
political crisis and the lack of trust in political parties, Ciudadanos'
response can hardly be considered populist.

Due to the crisis in Catalonia, Ciudadanos has been focusing more on the
nationalist elements of its discourse, however, political scientist
Lluís Orriols (Lluís Orriols 2018) has argued forcefully against
considering this a move towards populist positions. He rejects that
Citizens frames politics as elite vs people and argues instead that

> Citizens is a party that broke into Spanish politics to offer a
> technocratic response to the political crisis. The proposal of
> Citizens is not to articulate their discourse around returning power
> to the people but to empower a government of experts in order to
> achieve the effective and efficient policies that Spaniards (without
> distinctions) need. With this pedigree of technocratic cut on its
> backs, it is highly unlikely that Citizens will end up becoming a
> populist party of the extreme Spanish right. (Lluís Orriols 2018)

Although Ciudadanos expounds a criticism of corruption and renewal of
politics, this is not enough based on our definition to qualify as
populist given that we do not find a "discourse asserting that political
power has been monopolised by an elite estranged from ordinary people,
and that salient grievances of ordinary people can be attributed to the
self-serving decisions of that elite." Their anti-elitism is not framed
in moral as well as programmatic but simply as a democratic renewal.
Therefore, we have decided to follow the secondary literature on the
subject and not include it in the data.

During the last elections, **Catalan nationalist parties** have
displayed an anti-establishment and confrontational rhetoric with the
Spanish state in which they have combined nationalist claims with
populist ones defining 'the people' as the Catalan nation (Barrio 2017).
However, despite their importance in number of seats in the parliament,
they do not reach the 5% relevance threshold at the national level.
