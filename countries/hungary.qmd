## Independent Smallholders' and Peasant Party

The Independent Smallholders' and Peasant Party (*Fiiggetlen Kisgazda
Pirt*, FKgP), sometimes called just the "smallholders" party, was the
most popular party in the brief democratic period before the Communist
takeover in 1945. In its post-communist reformation its main mission was
to re-privatise rural land back to the peasants from whom it had been
confiscated under the previous regime (Ilonszki and Kurtán 1992, 423),
taking the character of a sectional agrarian party (Körösényi 1999, 66).
Under the leadership of József Torgyán it won almost 12% in the 1990
election and formed a coalition with the Hungarian Democratic Forum
(MDF) in the first post-communist government of Józef Antall. After this
government disappointed the party's aims of rural land redistribution
Torgyán left the coalition and the party split (Lomax 1995, 132).
Thereafter Torgyán consolidated his hold on the party in opposition and
led it to win 9% and 13% in 1994 and 1998 respectively. It then featured
as a junior partner in the Fidesz government of 1998-02, during which
further internal splits and corruption scandals saw its decline into
irrelevance by 2002 (Sitter 2011, 253).

The party has been frequently considered populist in the literature due
to the what Enyedi calls its "radical protest-party strategy" (Enyedi
2017, 178). In his "anti-elite approach" (Körösényi 1999, 45), Torgyán
used highly inflammatory rhetoric against his political rivals, whom he
accused of "selling out the country" (Batory 2002, 532). For example, at
one rally in Budapest he called the leaders of the governing parties
"disgusting pseudo-liberal worms and vultures that have inundated
\[our\] country" and that "as spring is coming, it is time for
Hungarians to launch a de-worming campaign" (cited in Nagle 1997, 44).
Similarly, when the government did not punish former communist leaders
for "crimes against Magyardom" Torgyán "tried to whip up a hysterical
campaign against the government for its readiness to compromise" (Fowkes
1999, 27). In contrast to this elite, Torgyán offered "easy solutions"
to the country\'s problems (Oltay 1995, 748). We've therefore coded FKgP
3 on OTH_POLCLASS.

Torgyán and the FKgP "pushed a radical anti-foreigner, Hungarian
nationalist politics" which increased in the years of IMF-imposed
austerity budgets (Nagle 1997, 44), at which time the party accused the
government of subservience to international financial institutions
(Lomax 1999, 116). We've not seen evidence of anti-foreign "others" in
the party's discourse before this period though, so we've coded it 2 on
OTH_FOREIGN in 1998 only, and 1 before this. Despite its right
wing-nationalism, sources did not reveal significant hostility towards
ethnic "others" (OTH_ETHNIC = 1) or hostility to migrants
(OTH_IMMIGRANTS =1). Some sources have noted that the party engaged in
"economic populism" (Rosůlek 2011, 77; Fowler 2004, 100), however this
seems to be a reference to the politics of land redistribution than
class-based grievances against business or the wealthy (OTH_ECONOMIC =
1). Likewise, we've seen no evidence for anything on the OTH_MILITARY
variable (= 1).

Although it did not have a clear ideological position (Körösényi 1999,
66), most studies of the 1990s Hungarian party system place the FKgP on
the right (Fazekas and Fekete 2018, 135), the "centre-right" (Rosůlek
2011, 69), or "conservative" side of politics (Z. Kovács 2001, 258;
Körösényi 1999, 32), and it is usually positioned in the "Christian
nationalist" camp (Enyedi 2017, 197). Many sources claim that the party
was "radical" (Körösényi 1999, 66; Rosůlek 2011, 77; Fowler 2004, 84),
but this appears to relate more to its populist theatrics and
accusations than its ideological stance. Hence we've labelled it R on
LRPOSITION.

As the FKgP had a long lineage to the pre-communist era, in its first
election it could not be considered a leader-dependent party. However,
by the 1994 election, internal purges and reforms changed this. Under
the "demagogic" leadership of Torgyán (Lomax 1999, 116), the party could
be better defined "by personal appeal of its charismatic leader than by
its political programme" (Enyedi 2017, 178), and under a party
constitution passed in 1991, as party president Torgyán had total
control over it (Lomax 1995, 131; Fowler 2004, 108). When the party's
parliamentary faction split in 1991, it was clear that the majority of
its members backed Torgyán and at the 1994 elections none of the
anti-Torgyán MPs were returned (Fowler 2004, 84--85). We've therefore
coded the party 2 on CHARISMA in 1990 and 3 from 1994.

Despite its advocacy for reforming the constitution (to recall MPS and
disband the Constitutional Court among other things) (Körösényi 1999,
45), Rosůlek has noted that the party was loyal to democracy (Rosůlek
2011, 77), and hence we've coded it 1 on LIBDEMNORMS. As the party was a
coalition member in the first post-communist government from 1990, we've
coded it 1 on INSIDER in 1990 and 2 afterwards.

## Hungarian Justice and Life Party (MIEP) 

The Party of Hungarian Justice and Life (*Magyar Igazság és Élet
Pártja*, MIÉP) was founded by former playwright István Csurka. Prior to
this Csurka had been the leader of a radical right populist faction of
the ruling Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF) (A. Kovács 2013, 223).
Csurka was ejected from the MDF in 1993 after publishing his notorious
'A few thoughts' tract the previous year, which was laced with
neo-Nazism and antisemitism in its accusations against the political
status quo (Szôcs 1998, 1100; Lomax 1995, 128). The name of the party
was selected to mimic the "Hungarian Life Movement", an inter-war
fascist group. The MIÉP had little success in its first election in
1994, but entered Parliament on a 5.47% vote share in the 1998 election.
Its vote slipped below 5% in 2002, after which it created a coalition
with Jobbik for the 2006 election, in which only received 2.2%.

Csuka's political narrative was that there had been no real political
change in the post-communist era, and that Hungary continued to be ruled
by a "dwarf minority" (Rosůlek 2011, 82) of "anti-Hungarians" (A. Kovács
2013, 223) and foreign interests (Lomax 1995, 128). He campaigned in a
way that pitted true Hungarians against a clear set of self-serving
political enemies (Tóth and Grajczjár 2015, 134; Bozóki and Kriza 2008,
9). In his own words, this enemy was the "small circle of liberal and
un-Hungarian people out to destroy the nation, who deliberately loot the
coffers and occupy all key positions" (Bozóki and Kriza 2008, 9). This
elite, a continuation of the old communist elite, was alleged to have
consciously betrayed the nation (Szôcs 1998, 1100) (OTH_POLCLASS = 3).

The MIÉP was "xenophobic" (Bozóki and Kriza 2008, 8), "ethno-radical"
(Egedy 2009, 49), and neo-Nazi (Markus 1998, 12), to the point that
ethnically-based politics was "the essence of its ideology" (Bozóki and
Kriza 2008, 9). In particular, it relied on a staunch antisemitism (M.
Szabó 2006, 9; A. Kovács 2013, 223; Pirro 2014a, 256; Lomax 1999, 120;
Chinatera-Stutte and Pető 2003, 6), which was evident in Csurka's 1992
tract (Lomax 1995, 128). In addition to claiming that the former
communist regime was controlled by Jews (LeBor 2008, 35), Csurka alleged
that the post-1989 regime was loyal to international Jewish interests
that aimed to "Palestinize" Hungary" (Tóth and Grajczjár 2015, 134).
According to some analysis, this was an outgrowth of the late communist
era, in which anti-semitism was a default form of protest (Szôcs 1998,
1097). In addition to this, Csurka and the MIÉP were hostile to Roma,
opposition to whom was evident in the party's platforms and manifestos
(Pirro 2014b, 616; Kenes 2021, 17). All of this is easily sufficient to
code the party 3 for OTH_ETHNIC. We've seen no mention of immigrants in
the scholarship on the MIÉP, probably because this was not a major
political issue in Hungary in the 1990s (OTH_IMMIGRANTS = 1).

That Hungarian politics and the Hungarian state was totally controlled
by foreign entities attempting to "recolonize" Hungary (Kenes 2021, 5)
was a constant theme in Csurka's narrative (Chinatera-Stutte and Pető
2003, 6; see also Bozóki and Kriza 2008, 15; Lomax 1995, 128). Political
rivals were deemed by the MIÉP to be "serving as the Hungarian outpost
of international financial circles" (Tóth and Grajczjár 2015, 135), and
forming "vassal governments" (Bozóki and Kriza 2008, 9) of those
interests. While this foreign other was often kept vague, Csurka and the
party were explicitly opposed to the financial bodies like the IMF
(Murer 2015, 84) and the EU (Kenes 2021, 5). In some phrasings, this was
a plutocratic conspiracy controlled from London, New York, Brussels and
Tel Aviv (Agocs and Agocs 1994, 79; Murer 1999, 23). In the words of
Kovács:

> The tensions caused by economic and cultural globalization were
> portrayed as a conflict between cosmopolitan and national interests,
> joining international integration as a loss of national sovereignty,
> and the social consequences of the economic and political transition
> as the result of being at the mercy of colonial masters (A. Kovács
> 2013, 223).

We've coded the MIÉP 3 on OTH_FOREIGN.

There is an overlap between this anti-foreign narrative and hostility
towards economic and financial powerbrokers. Csurka and the MIÉP have
identified "thieving capitalists" (Murer 2015, 83) and "Big Money"
(Bozóki and Kriza 2008, 16) as enemies of the Hungarian people, and
developed a narrative whereby global capitalist organisations have set
out to "ruin" Hungary (Murer 2015, 82; see also Kenes 2021, 5). While
this aspect of its rhetoric is somewhat thin in the scholarship on the
party, we've labelled it 3 on OTH_ECONOMIC based on the evidence
available, although this could be revisited. We've seen no evidence for
anything on the OTH_MILITARY variable (= 1).

The MIÉP is usually classed as "extreme right" (Palonen 2010, 14), or
"ultra-right-wing" (Lomax 1999, 117). Its policy framing and criticism
of capitalism had some left-leaning traits (Szôcs 1998, 1101), but
according to Bozóki and Kriza it did "not seek solutions to problems in
the domain of social and welfare politics, instead, it consistently
looks to answers steeped in racial and ethnic tint" (Bozóki and Kriza
2008, 9). Hence we've coded it FR. Csurka has been called a
"heavyweight" in his status as a leader and an intellectual (Szôcs 1998,
1105), who exerted "dominance" within the party and the far right more
generally (Dániel Mikecz 2015, 106). According to Bozóki and Kriza,
"Csurka exerts a completely determining influence on \[the parliamentary
MIÉP\] ... his authority in MIÉP is unquestionable and his weekly
'orientations' serve as signposts for the party faithful on political
and ideological issues." (Bozóki and Kriza 2008, 8--9). We've therefore
coded the MIÉP 3 on CHARISMA. Given that Csurka was a major faction
leader in the governing MDF party from 1990, we've labelled the MIÉP 2
on INSIDER

Csurka and the MIÉP were anti-liberal (Chinatera-Stutte and Pető 2003,
6) and anti-democratic (Kenes 2021, 5; Bozóki and Kriza 2008, 16).
Csurka made vague threats of violence if his enemies attempted their
grand plans (Chinatera-Stutte and Pető 2003, 6) and MIÉP rallies were
often attended by skinheads (Murer 1999, 36). Csurka also rejected media
criticism on the grounds that the media was controlled by Jews (Murer
1999, 17), and he rejected the results of elections and the legitimacy
of elected governments (Bozóki and Kriza 2008, 16). We've therefore
coded the party 3 on LIBDEMNORMS

## Fidesz

The "Alliance of Young Democrats" (*Fiatal Demokratak Szovetsege*,
'FIDESZ') is a former dissident youth movement from the late communist
period that transitioned into a mainstream party in the 1990s (M. Szabó
2011). The party has been in power twice in its history, between 1998
and 2002, and 2010-present, both times under the leadership of founder
Viktor Orbán. The party's second stint in power started in the context
of both the financial crisis and a host of scandals within the previous
socialist government (Rydliński 2018, 96), an environment which saw
Fidesz win a two thirds majority in Parliament (off a 53% vote). The
party has gone on to win twice more in succession, albeit not with the
same vote share as 2010. Since the 2006 election the party has
officially served in an electoral alliance with the historical Christian
Democratic Party (KNDP).

Exactly when Fidesz should be counted as populist by our definition is
debatable. According to numerous sources, the party was a mainstream
liberal party in the 1990s (M. Szabó 2011, 47), and studies of Hungarian
politics in this era do not suggest any populist characteristics (see
for example Fowler 2004; Hanley et al. 2008). Its 1998 election slogan
was "\[do\] more than change the government, but less than change the
system" (Egedy 2009, 47), and while in government 1998-02 it was a
progressive pro-European party (Palonen 2009, 329) whose policies were
not very different from the other parties (Palonen 2010, 11). According
to numerous sources, the party's defeat in 2002 was the trigger of its
major rhetorical shift towards populist discourse (M. Szabó 2011, 50),
at which point Orbán "transformed his rhetoric" and adopted
"anti-elitism" (Palonen 2018, 314), claiming that the new government was
the product of "electoral manipulation" at the expense of ordinary
Hungarians (M. Szabó 2006, 1; Halmai 2018, 299). While some sources
claim that the party fully embraced populist anti-elitism in the 2010
elections (Farkas 2018), or that this rhetoric picked up after its 2006
defeat (J. Szabó 2020, 30), we've followed the preponderance of the
literature (see for example Palonen 2009, 324--25; Enyedi and Róna 2018,
252) to conclude that 2006 was the first election in which Fidesz
engaged in populist rhetoric by our definition, and hence it is included
in the dataset from this point.

After its embrace of populist rhetoric, the party has been defined as
"anti-system, anti-establishment" (Palonen 2009, 323) and "anti-elitist"
(Ádám and Bozóki 2011, 3). Within Orbán's populist rhetoric, the elite
are considered to be the entirely of the political establishment (Halmai
2018; Csehi 2019, 1016). This included former communist figures (the
party's original target) (Egedy 2009, 50), who were called "forces from
the past" (Hegedüs 2019, 413) or simply "them" (M. Szabó 2011, 57),
accused by the party of converting political power to wealth after the
1989 transition (Csigó and Merkovity 2016, 2), and plotting a communist
restoration (Csehi 2019, 1016). In 2006, the leaking of a speech by
Socialist Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsány admitting to dishonesty in the
previous campaign triggered mass protests which prominently featured
Fidesz (Ádám and Bozóki 2011, 12). The party was equally scathing of
economic liberals, to the extent that it labelled the political class a
"clandestine conspiracy of Communism and Capitalism" (M. Szabó 2006,
10). Once in power, NGOs and civil society groups critical of the
government were consistently positioned within the political class (J.
Szabó 2020, 32), particularly after the 2015 migrant crisis (Etl 2022,
5). These groups were considered corrupt foreign agents "attempting to
enforce foreign interests upon Hungary" (Csehi 2019, 1016). In time this
"other" would be defined by the party as a shadowy but powerful class of
the international "elite" loyal to no nation but hostile to Hungary:

> Their faces are not visible, but are hidden from view; they do not
> fight directly, but by stealth; they are not honorable, but
> unprincipled; they are not national, but international, they do not
> believe in work, but speculate with money; they have no homeland, but
> feel that the whole world is theirs (cited in Csehi 2019, 1019)

Against this threat from the political class, Orbán styled himself and
Fidesz as the only true representative of the nation (Bozóki 2012, 12),
and in J. Szabó's words, "the only one capable of defending the people"
(J. Szabó 2020, 32). In fact, after losing in 2002, Orbán rejected the
idea that he and Fidesz were in "opposition" on the grounds that the
"nation cannot be in opposition" (Bozóki 2012, 12). For this reason
we've coded Fidesz 3 on OTH_POLCLASS from 2006 onward.

Despite pursuing generally neo-liberal policies (Ádám 2018, 12), the
financial elite have been a key element of the "elite" opposed to the
ordinary people in Orbán's populism. Ideologically, Fidesz has
encouraged anti-capitalist sentiments at home (Bozóki 2012, 18; Enyedi
2016, 15), specifically by denouncing "speculative capitalism" as being
an anti-Christian system through which "ordinary and trustworthy people
always \[turn\] out as losers" (Hegedüs 2019, 414). The party has
specifically opposed "liberal capitalist elites" (Hegedüs 2019, 413),
"bankers" (Batory 2016, 290), "new aristocrats," "opulent millionaires,"
"loafers" and "swindlers," for their exploitation of the Hungarian
people (Enyedi 2016, 14). It seems that this rhetoric only really picked
up in 2010 in the context of the financial crisis (Hegedüs 2019, 414).
It also seems that it was particularly foreign financial institutions
that were targeted in this way (Csigó and Merkovity 2016, 4), and after
assuming government in 2010 the party enacted taxes specifically
targeting multinational firms (Ádám 2018, 13), which were represented as
ways to hurt banks and multinationals while sparing ordinary people
(Bozóki 2012, 17). Nonetheless, domestic collaborators and beneficiaries
of this global capitalist elite were also key enemies of the people in
the party's language (Csehi 2019, 1016; Enyedi 2016, 14). The dates and
range of coding the party for OTH_ECONOMIC are difficult to determine,
but on the balance of secondary evidence we've coded it 1 in the 2006
election and 3 from 2010.

According to Palonen from 2002 onward the party's representation of the
"people" was in framed in ethnic terms (Palonen 2009, 329). It has
employed ethnocentric ideas against external "enemies" (Fabry 2019,
175), specifically targeting several non-ethnic Hungarian "others" such
as Roma, Muslims, Africans (L. Fekete 2016, 40), who have been targeted
with "institutionalized racism" by the Fidesz government (Fabry 2019,
167). Against the ideals of multi-culturalism, Orbán has stressed the
need to maintain ethnic homogeneity, as "too much mixing causes trouble"
(Fabry 2019, 175). This ethnocentrism has included an antisemitic
element (Becker 2010), which according to J. Szabó subtly "shapes
current political propaganda of Orbán's regime" (J. Szabó 2020, 32).
This is often alleged to be a driving factor in the government's fierce
opposition to Hungarian-born Jewish billionaire George Soros (Kalmar
2020), who became a major element of the "elite" (Csehi 2019, 1017), and
was accused of orchestrating the 2015 migrant crisis for profit (Kalmar
2020). The 2015 migrant crisis (see below) acted as a catalyst to
sharpen the government's rhetoric against ethnic others (Hegedüs 2019,
412), to the point that it started to match the more extreme Jobbik
party in its ethnic nationalism (Palonen 2018, 317). We've therefore
coded the party 2 on OTH_ETHNIC 2002-14, and then 3 after the migrant
crisis (2018).

After the 2015 migrant crisis, this ethno-nationalism was coupled with a
strong opposition to immigrants, who were represented as cultural
threats to Hungary and Europe (Palonen 2018, 317), and an "enemy" of the
Hungarian people (Gonda 2019, 606). Orbán and Fidesz claimed that
"migration will destroy us" (Lamour and Varga 2020, 342), that the
crisis constituted an "invasion" of Muslims (L. Fekete 2016, 40), and
that migrants were "waste" (Thorleifsson 2017, 318) hostile to the
Hungarian people (Palonen 2018, 316). In government Fidesz installed
billboards throughout the country stating that "The People have chosen:
The country needs to be defended" to signal its unwillingness to accept
migrants (Etl 2022, 3), and imposed laws punishing organizations accused
of aiding illegal immigration with jail time (Fabry 2019, 175; Majtényi,
Kopper, and Susánszky 2019). While this rhetoric clearly picked up from
2015, Majtényi (*et al)* make a convincing case that the party's
anti-immigrant rhetoric predates the crisis (Majtényi, Kopper, and
Susánszky 2019, 179). For this reason we've coded it 2 on OTH_IMMIGRANTS
from 2006-14 and 3 from 2018.

Foreign interests and states have been key elements of the "other" and
the "elite" within Fidesz's populist rhetoric. After his 2002 defeat
Orbán started blaming opponents who served "foreign interests" (Bozóki
2012, 12), and he consistently alleged that opponents are activists
attempting to enforce foreign "interests" on the Hungarian people
(Johnson and Barnes 2015, 546; J. Szabó 2020, 31). For example, in 2014,
he claimed that:

> we had had enough of the politics that is forever concerned with how
> we might satisfy the West, the bankers, big capital and the foreign
> press . . . Over the past four years we have overcome that . . .
> subservient mentality . . . Hungary will not succumb again! (cited in
> Johnson and Barnes 2015, 536)

While this category was often kept vague, the EU and the IMF have
probably been the most important specific "external enemies" in Fidesz's
populist rhetoric (Gonda 2019, 606; Batory 2016, 289; Hargitai 2020,
203; Ádám and Bozóki 2011, 14; Csehi 2019, 1016). Orbán and the party
have claimed, for example that: resistance to Brussels today is
equivalent to resistance against Vienna and Moscow in previous chapters
of the Hungarian nationalist story (Batory 2016, 290); that the EU was a
colonial power in its interactions with Hungary (Csehi 2019, 1018); that
Hungary was engaged in "a war of independence against the IMF" (Csehi
2019, 1018); and, after walking out of debt renegotiations in 2010, that
Hungary would "not accept diktats" from the IMF or EU in the future
because they were "not our bosses" (Fabry 2019, 173). Significantly for
our coding definitions, numerous sources claim that this has reached the
level of considering domestic political rivals to be puppets of these
foreign actors (Hegedüs 2019, 415; Johnson and Barnes 2015, 551). In
Enyedi's words, "Ordinary Hungarians were typically not contrasted \[by
Fidesz\] with the Hungarian elite, but rather with the international
economic and cultural establishment and their local representatives: the
'foreign-minded,' cosmopolitan leftists and liberals" (Enyedi 2016, 14).
This is sufficient to code the party consistently 3 on OTH_FOREIGN.
We've seen no evidence for any rhetoric on the OTH_MILITARY scale (= 1).

While the party has often had some left leaning economic policies
(Toplišek 2020, 394; Palonen 2009, 322), it is usually considered to be
a right-wing (Csigó and Merkovity 2016, 1) and
"conservative-nationalist" party (Ádám and Bozóki 2011, 7). Where it
should be placed within the right of the ideological spectrum is
somewhat more difficult, as some have considered it somewhat "moderate"
(Boda et al. 2015, 876) and "centrist" (Palonen 2009, 325), and others a
"hard right" party (Fabry 2019, 165) at various points in its history.
On the whole its economic policy is generally liberal (Ádám 2018, 12),
and we've coded it R on LRPOSITION, although this could be revisited.

Most secondary sources identify Orbán's political charisma and conclude
that it has been a critical element of the party's image and success
(Körösényi 2019; Enyedi 2016, 2016; Ádám and Bozóki 2011, 3; Körösényi
and Patkós 2017; Pappas 2016). As a party Fidesz has been "structured
around its leader" (Lamour and Varga 2020, 336). In Bozóki's
interpretation, since 2003 he "transformed Fidesz from a democratic to a
highly hierarchical, centralized party which is controlled exclusively
by him", and that "Orbán has not simply been an elected representative
of Fidesz, it is Fidesz which belong to him and represent him" (Bozóki
2012, 17, 12). Similarly, Antal considers Orbán's Hungary a case of
"leader democracy" (Antal 2017, 11). This is sufficient evidence to code
the party 3 on CHARISMA. Given that Orbán served as Prime Minster before
2006, we have coded Fidesz 3 on INSIDER for the entirety of its
inclusion in the dataset.

The secondary literature has uniformly considered Fiedesz to be hostile
to liberal democratic norms in that it is "authoritarian" (Ádám 2018),
"autocratic" (Pappas 2019, 77), and directing Hungary on an illiberal
and authoritarian "turn" in power (Bánkuti, Halmai, and Scheppele 2012;
Ádám and Bozóki 2016, 104). Ideologically, Orbán has officially declared
that "liberalism" was an enemy of the nation in 2014 (Hegedüs 2019,
416), specified a number of philosophical objections to it (which he
considered different to democracy) (Scheppele 2019), and declared that
his government would serve as a model alternative to Western liberal
democracy (Toplišek 2020, 393). In Orbán's words "the new state that we
are constructing in Hungary is an illiberal state, a non-liberal state"
(J. Szabó 2020, 31). This shift relates mostly to the constitutional
changes which centralised power under the Fidesz government (L. Fekete
2016, 44). After winning a two-thirds supermajority in the 2010
election, Orbán used this control to give his parliamentary majority
even more power, "effectively dismantling all checks and balances on
executive power" (Ádám 2018, 12), and engaging in "unconventional moves
limiting constitutional rights in Hungary" (J. Szabó 2020, 31). Bozóki
has called this a "constitutional coup d'état" (Bozóki 2012, 17). In
government the party has tried to force out judges opposed to its
initiatives (Kornai 2015; L. Fekete 2016), curtailed the power of the
constitutional court (Bozóki 2012, 17), and "undermin\[ed\] the
institutional autonomy of the judiciary system" (Ádám and Bozóki 2011,
15). Constitutional reforms allowed Fidesz to nominate judges without
parliamentary approval, after which it passed laws that the prior court
would have struck down (Bánkuti, Halmai, and Scheppele 2012, 139).
Regarding media freedom, government controlled media stations refused
airtime for the opposition under Fidesz's rule (Bozóki 2012, 17), and
the government forced hundreds of private media owners to collectivise
their outlets under the control of a state-linked entity led by a former
Fidesz lawmaker (J. Szabó 2020, 33). The party also stacked state media
with politically friendly managers (Bánkuti, Halmai, and Scheppele 2012,
141), and passed a law establishing the new "National Media and
Info-communications Authority" with leadership elected by parliament
(which was dominated by Fidesz at the time), which had carte blanch to
regulate the media and fine journalists and institutions which print
content which it deems "improper" content (Fabry 2019, 176). The Fidesz
government has also created new security units that have acted as a
"private army" for Orbán (Fabry 2019, 176)*,* restricted the
opposition's capacity for mobilisation during elections (Palonen 2018,
315) and engaged in a 'penal populism' of adding minimum life sentences
to habitual violent offenders (Boda et al. 2015). Before its second
stint in government, Orbán criticised the legitimacy of the 2002 and
2006 elections, which Fidesz lost (Ádám 2019, 387). For these reasons
many consider Hungary to no longer be a democracy under Orbán (Bozóki
and Heged\\Hus 2018), and that the party has "washed away" the rule of
law and threatens basic human rights (Csigó and Merkovity 2016, 299).
For these reasons we've coded it 3 on LIBDEMNORMS from 2006.

## Movement for a Better Hungary/Jobbik 

Jobbik is the successor of the "Right-Wing Youth Association"
(Jobboldali Ifjúsági Közösség, JOBBIK) founded by a group of university
students in 2002. The following year it officially became a party and
changed its name while keeping its acronym to become "Movement for a
Better Hungary" (note that the name is actually a play on words as
"Jobb" means both "better" and "further to the right"). The new party
formed an electoral alliance with MIÉP which received only 2.2% in the
2006 polls (A. Kovács 2013, 224). The following election in 2010 saw the
party's electoral breakthrough on its own, totalling almost 17% and
winning the third largest number of seats in Parliament, following a
similarly strong performance in EU elections the previous year. This
occurred in the context of the economic crisis and a number of high
profile crimes involving Roma perpetrators (Enyedi and Róna 2018, 255).
Subsequent elections in 2014 and 2018 saw it reach 20% and 19%
respectively, each time mobilising partially off its youth support and
strong online presence (Kim 2016, 351; Karl 2017). Jobbik is considered
by many to be the successor to the MEÍP on the far right (Kenes 2021,
5), and has claimed this itself (Tóth and Grajczjár 2015, 140). Its
influence is widely seen to have pushed Fidesz further to the right in
rhetoric and policy (Czibere and Kovách 2022, 738). Gábor Vona became
leader of the party in 2006, but stepped down after failing to reach his
target performance in the 2018 elections.

A challenge with Jobbik is how to account for its changes over time.
Around 2014-16, the party embarked on a *cukisagkampany* ('cuteness
campaign') to moderate its image and broaden its appeal (Pirro 2019,
794) Vona claimed to be "killing the soul of Jobbik" in order to mature
it" (Hyttinen 2022, 5), aiming to convert it into a centrist "people's
party" (Kenes 2021, 8). As a part of this strategy, Vona offered an
apology to those who had been offended by earlier remarks (Metz and
Oross 2020, 6), and pledged not to make any more (including burning the
EU flag) (Enyedi and Róna 2018, 264). The party then changed some of its
policies on the EU (Kenes 2021, 8; Enyedi and Róna 2018, 264), started
working with other parties in Parliament (Goldstein 2021, 28), and
altered its rhetoric such that its "new slogans are not directed against
anyone" (Hyttinen 2022, 14). It's unclear exactly when this transition
began, and therefore when it should be considered to have taken affect.
Some say it emerged before the 2014 elections (Kenes 2021, 8), but most
analysis suggests it only solidified after those elections (Lubarda
2020, 819--20), and took root in 2016 (Héjj 2017, 88; Metz and Oross
2020, 6), after an aberration back to nativist nationalism during the
2015 migrant crisis (Hyttinen 2022, 5). By 2018, a group frustrated with
the transition split to form a rival party, *Mi Hazánk* ('Our Homeland')
(Lubarda 2020, 819--20). Despite the change, the preponderance of the
literature still considers the reformed Jobbik to be populist (Lubarda
2020, 820), albeit less violent, nationalistic, and ethnocentric, with
some going as far as concluding the transition to be merely a
"redecoration of a façade" (Héjj 2017, 89). Even Hyttinen, who considers
the transition to be significant, considers the reformed party to be "a
more flexible right-wing populism" (Hyttinen 2022, 23). Others have
noted that: the shift did not lead the party to change its elite or
membership (Dániel Kovarek et al. 2017, 66; Héjj 2017, 89); that changes
mainly related to national level discourse, not the actions of local
leaders (Dániel Kovarek et al. 2017, 78); that Vona still made efforts
to tie the party to more extreme movements (Tóth and Grajczjár 2015,
137). We have concluded that the party has remained essentially populist
through 2018, and that the changes should not alter any coding decisions
for the 2018 elections, although this could be revisited.

Jobbik has been classed as an "anti-system party" (Enyedi and Róna 2018,
252). "anti-elite" (Enyedi and Róna 2018, 256; Bíró-Nagy, Boros, and
Varga 2012, i), "Anti-corruption" (Pirro 2019, 792) and
"anti-establishment" (Enyedi 2016, 17), the latter typified in its
presence on the frontline of chaotic protests which followed the leaked
speech of PM Gyurcsany in 2006 (Kenes 2021, 6; Kim 2016, 347). The party
holistically blamed social grievances on "destructive behaviour of the
political establishment" (Lugosi 2018, 223), which it articulated with
what Pytlas calls a "conspiracy-like" framing (Pytlas 2013, 170). From
its breakthrough 2010 election it specifically targeted "political
criminals" (Pirro 2019, 794; Hyttinen 2022, 3) and "political crime"
(Kenes 2021, 10), alleging that the political establishment betrayed the
nation for its own direct benefit (Pirro 2014b, 617). In Vona's words
"Let's be straight about it for once: they have deliberately and
completely destroyed the country" (A. Kovács 2013, 226). This allegation
is levelled against the entirety of the political establishment rather
than just a few parties (Kim 2016, 349; Varga 2014, 795--96; Batory
2016, 296; Bíró-Nagy, Boros, and Vasali 2013, 238). In the words of Biro
Nagy (et al.), Jobbik "continually alleges that the apparently
controversial debates conducted between leading political forces are
simply a front to conceal the fact that they are all in league with each
other and operate in close-knit networks" (Bíró-Nagy, Boros, and Varga
2012, 4). As stated in the party's 2010 Manifesto: "In Hungary the word
'politician' is now synonymous with the word 'scoundrel'... Our goal is
not merely the abolition of corruption, it is rather the cessation of
the existence of politicians -- as lawmakers -- as being above the law"
(cited in Kenes 2021, 10). One of the elements of this attack on the
political establishment was the claim that the post 1989 transition from
communism was a "stolen transition" (Enyedi and Róna 2018, 263), and
that the old communist elite is still in power (Bíró-Nagy, Boros, and
Varga 2012, 2; A. Kovács 2013, 225--26), in league with other liberal
newcomers (Lugosi 2018, 219). While Vona was once linked to Fidesz, from
2010 it too was considered by Jobbik to be part of the corrupt elite
(Murer 2015, 87; Bíró-Nagy, Boros, and Varga 2012, 2--3; Héjj 2017, 90),
becoming by 2014 the core of the "political establishment" (Pirro 2019,
794) only disguising itself as conservative (Tóth and Grajczjár 2015,
144). Vona claimed Orban only criticised Jobbik because "we do not want
to prosecute only the red \[Socialist\], but also the orange \[Fidesz\]
evildoers" (cited in Varga 2014, 802) This did not change after the
party's moderation from 2016. In the 2018 election for example, it's
posters showed Orbán and other Fidesz politicians with the caption:
"they are stealing" (Héjj 2017, 90). In contrast to this elite, the
party represented itself as a spontaneous manifestation of the people,
in the words of one of its MPs: "The moment has arrived when people
yearning for both justice and self-determination no longer await the
arrival of change from politics, but rather they themselves effect
change!" (cited in A. Kovács 2013, 226). This is more than sufficient
evidence to show that the party reached 3 on the OTH_POLCLASS variable.

From its foundation Jobbik has been a "nativist" (Borbáth and Gessler
2021), "ultra-nationalistic" (Thorleifsson 2021, 188) "openly racist"
(Hyttinen 2022, 3), and "xenophobic" (Lubarda 2020, 819) party with an
explicitly ethnocentric idea of the Hungarian nation (Bozóki and Cueva
2021, 111), including ethnic Hungarians living in neighbouring states
(Lázár 2015, 229) and excluding Roma and Jews (Ádám and Bozóki 2016,
106; Enyedi and Róna 2018, 256). The party's motto is "Hungary for
Hungarians" (Ilikova and Tushev 2020, 329) and its manifestos have shown
"strong traces of overt racism" (Lugosi 2018, 225). Hostility toward
Roma peoples has been the most important element of this (Ilikova and
Tushev 2020, 329; Pirro 2014b, 616; Bíró-Nagy, Boros, and Vasali 2013,
234). Exploiting a number of high profile crimes committed by Roma
(Pirro 2014b, 255), Jobbik has mainstreamed the narrative of
*cigánybűnözés* ("Gypsy crime") (Pirro 2019, 792), and "Gypsy terror"
(Tóth and Grajczjár 2015, 138), to the extent of claiming that Roma were
genetically predisposed to be criminals (Kenes 2021, 13; Kyriazi 2016,
2533). More than any other issue, the struggle conflict between the Roma
and non-Roma was placed at "the heart of its political struggle" in its
breakthrough years (A. Kovács 2013, 225). Roma are also target on
welfare chauvinist grounds as lazy and unworthy of state benefits
(Dániel Kovarek et al. 2017, 68), and "parasites" on the nation (Kyriazi
2016, 2534). The party has "called for a policy of forced assimilation"
(Pirro 2014b, 616). Though some consider the party in 2010 to be less
antisemitic than the MIEP (Pirro 2019, 792; Szabados 2015, 49),
antisemitism has still been a core part of the party's narrative in the
era of its electoral success (Murer 2015, 80; A. Kovács 2013, 227; Ádám
and Bozóki 2011, 15; Thorleifsson 2021, 197). Speeches my Jobbik MPs,
for example, show that many party leaders "consider the Gypsies to be
tools in the hands of Zionist conspirators against the Hungarian nation"
(Enyedi 2016, 17). Jobbik was originally very favourable to Islam, but
made a U-turn on this after the migrant crisis (Thorleifsson 2021;
Dániel Kovarek et al. 2017). At this point the party started to engage
in anti-Islam narratives about crime and radicalism. "Softening" this
nativist rhetoric has been a major component of the party's image chance
since 2014-16 (Ilikova and Tushev 2020, 329; Palonen 2018, 317).
According to some analysis this was in response to Fidesz embracing such
rhetoric (Hyttinen and Näre 2017). However, while the party began to
distance itself from its most radical elements, many of its members did
not (Kenes 2021, 15), particularly at the local level (Dániel Kovarek et
al. 2017, 78), and Borbáth and Gessler claim that any shift in this
rhetoric was re-elevated by the 2018 election (Borbáth and Gessler 2021,
13). While there may be an argument that the party should be coded 2 on
OTH_ETHNIC in 2018, on the balance of evidence we've kept this at 3
throughout.

Jobbik has also engaged in "anti-immigrant" rhetoric (Ilikova and Tushev
2020, 239). As with Fidesz, the story here is different before and after
the 2015 migrant crisis. Before it, immigration was an "insignificant"
issue (Szabados 2015, 54), and Jobbik focused very little on immigration
compared to other far-right parties (Bíró-Nagy, Boros, and Vasali 2013,
231; Dániel Kovarek et al. 2017, 72). However a number of sources
mention that it warned of the potential threat of migration coming from
the recently enlarged EU (Pirro 2019, 792), and according to Szabados it
organised a "hate campaign" against Chinese immigrants, whom it accused
of stealing jobs, and destroying local businesses (Szabados 2015, 54).
Because of this we've coded it 2 on OTH_IMMIGRANT in 2010 and 2014.
After the migrant crisis, immigrants were elevated to be a key "other"
in Jobbik's discourse (Kovarek et al. 2017, 72), when "Inflammatory
imagery, rhetoric and antimigrant sentiments were heavily present in
\[its\] online campaigns, newsletters and internet debates"
(Thorleifsson 2021, 195). One Jobbik mayor formed a "migrant hunter"
militia and officially banned Muslims from entering his village in 2016
(Dániel Kovarek et al. 2017, 64), and some have claimed that the party
has been trying to out-do Fidesz on anti-immigrant toughness (Szabados
2015, 55). We've therefore coded the party 3 on OTH_IMMIGRANT in 2018.

Jobbik has been described as "anti-banking" (Murer 2015, 79) and
"anti-capitalist" (Pirro 2019, 792; Kenes 2021, 5). Party leaders have
clarified that they are not against the market system totally, but just
the "excessive economic liberalism" that Hungary got "lured" into after
1990 (Goldstein 2021, 27), and that they favour small and medium sized
Hungarian owned businesses (Bíró-Nagy, Boros, and Varga 2012, 798).
Foreign multinational firms, however, are a key enemy of the Hungarian
people (Bíró-Nagy, Boros, and Vasali 2013, 238; Tóth and Grajczjár 2015,
141), and the party has advocated confiscating assets owned by foreign
investors and handing them to Hungarians (Tóth and Grajczjár 2015, 141).
Kovarek describes the party's narrative thusly: "lobby groups financed
by international capital, through their local lackeys, are executing
their plot to destroy nations and indigenous values" (Dániel Kovarek et
al. 2017, 68). This hostility is in many instances bound together with
the party's antisemitic discourse (Dániel Kovarek et al. 2017, 68). It
is mainly foreign financial elites who are target here, but some sources
refer to the fact that Jobbik "presented the rich elite and the banks...
as a threat to society" (Vratislav Havlík 2012, 148--49). We've
therefore coded Jobbik 3 on the OTH_ECONOMIC variable.

Jobbik has also focussed heavily on foreign and "colonizing" global
elites as enemies of the Hungarian people (A. Kovács 2013, 226). It has
articulated a narrative whereby a global elite is attempting to
eradicate the nation as the foundation of human community" (cited in
Ádám and Bozóki 2016, 109). Vona voiced hostility to Western
(particularly American and Isreali) interests and fidelity to Eastern
(Russian, Iranian) ones (A. Kovács 2013, 228). While this narrative is
somewhat vague (and relates to global capital as well as foreign
states), Jobbik has been particularly opposed to the EU and NATO. Party
members have burnt the EU flag and threw one from a Parliamentary window
(Lázár 2015, 230; Ádám and Bozóki 2016, 110), and according to Bíró Nagy
(et al), the party "attributed almost every negative trend in Hungary to
the supposed background machinations of the EU." (Bíró-Nagy, Boros, and
Vasali 2013, 240). It has accused NATO of "serving American interests
unconditionally" (Murer 2015, 93), and developed irredentist positions
regarding Hungary's neighbours (Pirro 2014b, 614). Domestic rivals have
routinely been seen as lackeys and representatives of this global elite.
In Bíró Nagy (et al)'s words, "Jobbik's rhetoric has thus right from the
start sought to portray national politics as serving international
interests" (Bíró-Nagy, Boros, and Varga 2012, 4). There is evidence that
since the party's 2014-16 moderation its positions regarding the EU have
changed (Hyttinen 2022, 11), but as with the prior categories, it
remains to be seen whether the party's general discourse regarding
foreign elites had shifted fundamentally in 2018, hence we've coded it 3
on OTH_FOREIGN. We've not seen any evidence of OTH_MILITARY rhetoric (=
1).

Jobbik has been consistently placed on the "extreme right" (Ádám and
Bozóki 2011, 15) "radical right-wing" (Tóth and Grajczjár 2015, 133),
"far right" (Ádám and Bozóki 2016, 99; Kyriazi 2016, 2531),
"ultra-right" (Ilikova and Tushev 2020, 328) end of the spectrum, and
often considered either "neo-fascist" (Becker 2010, 29) or "blatantly
fascist" (Bíró-Nagy, Boros, and Vasali 2013, 238) owing to its militant
nationalism. However scholars have long noted the gulf between the
party's economic policy and its cultural politics, the former being
left-leaning and the latter far right (Bíró-Nagy, Boros, and Varga 2012,
5). The party claims to advocate "a stronger role of the state in the
economy, redistribution of wealth and a revision of privatization
contracts" (Pirro 2014b, 615; see also Tóth and Grajczjár 2015, 142;
Lugosi 2018), and has been notably more economically interventionist in
its policies than Fidesz. Despite this, the rejection of the pre-1990
communist economy is a "cornerstone of its identity" (Bíró-Nagy, Boros,
and Varga 2012, 2; see also Dániel Kovarek et al. 2017, 71; Héjj 2017,
84). After its transition in 2014-16, it started to define itself as
"centrist" (Lubarda 2020, 819), or "modern conservative" (Kenes 2021,
10). As with the above categories, we've erred on the side of leaving
its coding consistent rather than changing it for the 2018 election
(LRPOSITION = FR).

A handful of texts on Jobbik have noted that Gabor Vona has been a
"dynamic" (Tóth and Grajczjár 2015, 136) and "charismatic" leader of the
party (Hyttinen 2022, 3), and a "great orator" (Metz and Oross 2020, 6).
Sources also note that the party organisation was largely centralised
under his control during his tenure (Metz and Oross 2020, 13--14).
However, references to the significance of Vona's charisma and persona
to the image of Jobbik are notably rare compared to secondary literature
about other populist parties, and some clearly refute the idea that the
party is a one-man show (Havlík 2012, 144). While his leadership was
clearly important to the party's success after 2006, we've not concluded
that this reached the highest level on our CHARISMA coding, and hence
we've coded the party 2 here. Though Vona was once close to Orban
(Szabados 2015, 49), neither he nor Jobbik has ever served in government
(INSIDER = 1).

Jobbik has consistently threatened liberal democratic norms.
Ideologically, it has joined Fidesz in declaring its opposition to
liberal democracy (which they called "refuse imported from abroad") with
a system in which the state is ideologically engaged in the support of
the Hungarian ethnic majority (Enyedi 2016, 12). It has also questioned
the fundamental merits of democracy (Bíró-Nagy, Boros, and Vasali 2013,
232), and many Jobbik leaders "reject democracy entirely" (Enyedi and
Róna 2018, 264). Its most significant threat to liberal democratic norms
however is its relationship with paramilitary violence (Kenes 2021, 8).
In 2007 Vona created the *Magyar Gárda*, or "Hungarian Guard", as a
paramilitary organisation loyal to Jobbik and active at its rallies
(Ádám and Bozóki 2016, 106; Thorleifsson 2021, 188; Szabados 2015, 49).
Created to "restore law and order" (Pirro 2019, 793), the group has
sported paraphernalia associated with the Arrow Cross fascist movement
active in the Second World War (Ilikova and Tushev 2020, 329). It was
disbanded by court order in 2009, but has reformed under various new
names and long remained linked to Jobbik (Murer 2015, 88; Kim 2016,
348). Jobbik militias like this have demonstrated against alleged "gypsy
terror" (Feischmidt and Szombati 2017), throwing bottles and rocks at
homes believed to be owned by Roma (Murer 2015, 89). According to
numerous studies, the founding of the *Magyar Gárda* constituted the
"real breakthrough" that facilitated Jobbik's subsequent electoral
success (Bíró-Nagy, Boros, and Vasali 2013, 229; see also Varga 2014,
794). This is more than sufficient to code Jobbik 3 on LIBDEMNORMS.

## Politics can be different 

"Politics Can be Different" (*Lehet Más a Politika*, LMP) was a green
party founded in 2008 by a collection of activists led by András
Schiffer. It built on the legacy of prior green movements, especially
the Protect the Future movement (Tóth 2015), and succeeded in part due
to the left wing void in the political system in the 2010 election where
it won 7% of the vote (Daniel Mikecz 2017, 359). In its first term in
Parliament the party split on the question of how much to cooperate with
the other anti-Orbán parties in the run up to the 2014 election. Some
MPs favoured cooperation at the expense of the party's original
anti-party independence, whereas the official party chose to remain
non-aligned for the election (see Tóth 2015). Despite losing the former
faction, the party maintained its presence in parliament (with 5%) and
improved again in 2018 under the leadership of Ákos Hadházy.

LMP is occasionally considered non-populist in the literature (Csigó and
Merkovity 2016, 2), in part due to its "intellectual style discourse"
that was in stark contrast to Orbán and Fidesz (Tóth 2015, 247), and its
related image of being "too professional" in the eyes of many voters
(Glied 2014, 50). It also engaged after 2010 in a "constructive and
halfhearted oppositional role" (Tóth 2015, 248), and included a socially
inclusive message that contrasted with the *völkisch* nationalism of
other populist (Lubarda 2020, 824).

Despite this, the description of the party's message in the literature
paints a clear picture of populist discourse as we have defined it. This
message was "anti-elitist" (Vratislav Havlík 2012, 136), "anti-party"
(Sitter 2011, 260), "anti-establishment" (Dániel Mikecz 2015, 103;
Engler 2020; Pirro and Della Porta 2021, 440), and "strongly
anti-corruption" (Vratislav Havlík 2012, 138). It claimed that all other
established parties were corrupt (Sitter 2011, 260), including those on
the left (Daniel Kovarek and Littvay 2019, 574), offering itself (as its
name suggests) as a complete renewal of the democratic process in the
interests of ordinary people (Vratislav Havlík 2012, 141). The party's
campaigns portrayed a country in ruin due to the ruling elite's internal
power struggles in pursuit of self-interests, hidden behind the mere
façade of representative democracy (Tóth 2015, 237; Vratislav Havlík
2012, 150). Despite its professional image, it nonetheless described the
political situation in "apocalyptic" terms (Tóth 2015, 237). In Fábián's
synopsis:

> LMP's critique of the existing political, economic and social order is
> extensive. Most importantly, LMP sees itself as an anti-party,
> standing outside and above the existing Hungarian political structure
> that it considers corrupt, self-serving and obstructing the creation
> of a meaningful democracy (Fábián 2010, 1008).

Alongside its green and progressive policy agenda, the party ramped up
its anti-corruption message under the leadership of Hadházy, who was a
former Fidesz city councillor who left the ruling party as a corruption
whistle-blower (Pirro and Della Porta 2021, 443). In the 2018 elections,
for example, LMP campaigns featured slogans that reduced political
problems to elite corruption, such as 'Against stealing: LMP' or 'Those
who stole are going to jail!' (cited in Daniel Kovarek and Littvay 2019,
576). We have considered this sufficient evidence to code the party 3 on
OTH_POLCLASS, although its professional and occasionally "constructive"
image may make a case for this to be 2.

The LMP's green progressive agenda pitted it against both global
capitalism and multinational firms (Fábián 2010, 1008), especially
monopolies (Lubarda 2020, 822). According to Havlík, it claimed that the
parties that remained in parliament were controlled by economic
oligarchs (Vratislav Havlík 2012, 150) (OTH_ECONOMIC = 3). This also had
an anti-foreign dimension, with foreign ownership of assets (Lubarda
2020, 823), the EU, and international corporations targeted in the LMP's
discourse (Fábián 2010, 1007). This appears not to have reached the
point of arguing that foreign interests control the elite, hence
OTH_FOREIGN = 2.

In contrast to other Hungarian populist parties, LMP did not have an
ethnocentric definition of the people, their "others," or the elite. For
example, it was notably progressive regarding the integration of Romani
into Hungarian society (Vratislav Havlík 2012, 149) (OTH_ETHNIC = 1).
Likewise, even after the 2015 migrant crisis significantly impacted the
discourse of other parties, LMP "did not take a stand" on migration in
the 2018 elections (Daniel Kovarek and Littvay 2019, 575) (OTH_IMMIGRANT
= 1). We also could not find any evidence of OTH_MILITARY discourse (=
1).

Positioning LMP on a left-right ideological axis is very difficult. The
core if its initial outlook was in green politics, identifying itself as
an "ökopárt" (party of ecology) (Fábián 2010, 1007), and its leadership
deliberately positioned itself beyond left and right wing viewpoints
(Fábián 2015, 332; Dániel Mikecz 2015, 103). In that capacity it has
been called "eco-libertarian" (Becker 2010, 34), and "agrarian populist"
(Lubarda 2020, 822). However most sources claim that the party's
policies were generally "left leaning" (see Tóth 2015, 232; Glied 2014,
39), in relation to both economic and social policy (Vratislav Havlík
2012, 149), and that it appealed mainly to left-leaning voters in its
initial election (Fábián 2010, 1007). Later sources however suggest that
the party's leadership pulled the party to the centre (Engler 2020; S.
Fekete and Fazekas 2018, 164), or even the centre-right (Lubarda 2020,
812). Based on the above we've coded the party L on LRPOSITION in 2010
and 2014, and CL in 2018.

Numerous sources stress that under Schiffer's leadership the LMP did not
"present charismatic leading figures" that could personify its message
(Tóth 2015, 256; Glied 2014, 50; Papp and Zorigt 2016), in part due to
its insistence on avoiding centralised leadership structures (Vratislav
Havlík 2012, 145; Vratislav Havlík and Pinková 2012, 290). The party's
messaging became somewhat more personalised under Hadházy and the LMP
Prime Minster candidate Bernadett Szél (Daniel Kovarek and Littvay 2019,
576), but not to the point of registering on the CHARISMA variable,
hence we have coded it as 1 consistently. The party and its leaders have
never been central figures in government (Hadházy was only a local
representative when he was in Fidesz until 2013) (INSIDER = 1). Party
members have occasionally considered their politics as "revolutionary",
but not to the extent of advocating system change (Tóth 2015, 241). In
fact the party had a strong "rule of law" focus and joined the fight
against Orbán's illiberal reforms after 2010 (Vratislav Havlík 2012,
149--51) (LIBDEMNORMS = 1).

## Not included

**S**ome of the literature suggests that the **Hungarian Democratic
Forum** (*Magyar Demokrata Fórum*, MDF) was a populist party in its
early years (see for example Sitter 2011, 255). However the movement was
more of an "umbrella" movement of various factions (Palonen 2018, 313),
only some of which appear populist (specifically that of István Csurka
which went on to become the MIÉP). Its leader Józef Antall does not
appear to have used populist rhetoric himself. Hence we've not included
it in the dataset.
