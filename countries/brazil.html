<p>Brazil was controlled by the military for more than twenty years, from 1964 until 1985. In 1985 José Sarney was elected to the presidency of Brazil and initiated the transition process. A new constitution was drafted in 1988 and the first direct presidential elections were held in 1989. Three populist candidates competed in those elections: Fernando Collor de Mello, Luis Inácio Lula da Silva and Leonel Brizola.</p>
<section id="fernando-collor-de-mello" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fernando-collor-de-mello">Fernando Collor de Mello</h2>
<p>Collor de Mello was a member of an important family in Brazil and had been elected as mayor of Maceió and governor of the province of Alagoas before running for president. He held no position of relevance in the previous regime and was little known to the public before 1989. Coming from a underdeveloped and impoverished region, Collor de Mello run a campaign as an outsider differentiating himself from traditional politicians (Panizza, 2000: 181). He engineered a modern communication’s campaign based entirely on his personal figure (he ran for a small and not well-known political party). His campaign surpassed the traditional right-wing candidate and then defeated Lula’s party in the second round. I have coded 1 for Insider Populism and 3 for Personality Dependent.</p>
<p>Callor de Mello based his campaign in fighting against corruption, criticizing in particular the “marajás” (high ranked civil servants) (Noielli, 2008). As Panizza puts it, “he was uncompromising in his attacks against the state’s bureaucracy, the political establishment and, particularly, against President Sarney” (Panizza, 2000: 182). He viewed the restoration of social order as a moral crusade against the “privileged political and economic elite that had become rich at the expense of the poor” (Panizza, 2000: 182). Collor de Mello claimed that he aimed “to make the right indignant and leave the left perplexed” and he even rejected endorsement by business groups (Panizza, 2000: 182-183). He defended the need to implement neoliberal policies in order to reduce the hyperinflation that the country suffered at the moment (Noielli, 2008) and he liberalized and opened the economy by drastically lowering the import tariffs (Panizza, 2000: 185). Collor de Mello was supported by important TV companies and right-wing groups of Brazil which wished to stop the rise of Lula (Ortiz de Zárate, 2016). I labelled 3 for Political Class and Financial Elite, “Right” for ideology and, given his desire to liberalize and open the economy against the wishes of a fraction of Brazil’s industrial elite, 1 in Foreign Interests.</p>
<p>Collor de Mello implemented a number of shock policies designed to liberalize the country, reduce hyperinflation and break with the previous statist model of economic development (Panizza, 2000: 185). In line with his populist and personalist style, he also attempted to run with the support of the public opinion but without the backing of a stable party alliance. Panizza describes it in the following way: “Once in office, Collor faced two options: he could either radicalize the ‘politics of anti-politics’ campaign and refuse to acknowledge the legitimacy of the existing political establishment or, alternatively, become immersed in the political game, thus losing his status as political outsider. Eventually, Collor fell between two stools” (Panizza, 2000: 187-188). When his economic policies failed and he was accused of corruption by his own brother, the congress decided to impeach him. He resigned just before the impeachment, but congress incapacitated him for office for 8 years. Therefore, although Collor de Mello did not take the authoritarian route of Fujimori in Peru, he engaged in extensive corruption and refused to collaborate with parties in the parliament. I believe this should deserve a 2 in Violation of LD norms. I have not been able to find any negative discourse of immigrants, the military or ethnic others.</p>

<section id="workers-party" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="workers-party">Workers’ Party</h2>
<p>The Workers’ Party is the most important party in Brazilian politics of the last decades. It was founded by a group of academics, intellectuals and union leaders led by Luis Inácio Lula da Silva, a popular union leader with no formal educational background. The party had a strong support base among labor unions and its organizational structure was that of a mass bureaucratic party (Hunter, 2010: 22). The party fits better in the classification of a socialist party than in a populist one, particularly when compared to a clear left-wing populist party such as Brizola’s PDT. Conniff (1999: 59) stated that Lula “could not even remotely be called populist” but Zedillo (2002: 55) argued that Lula ran on a populist platform. Lula da Silva ran unsuccessfully as a presidential candidate in 1989, 1994, 1998 and finally won in 2002. During this time, the party went through an important transformation in its discourse moderating its radicalism with every electoral bid (Hunter, 2010: 60).</p>
<p>The party’s platform was rooted in achieving socialism and in an opposition to trade liberalization, labor ‘flexibilization’ and neoliberal reforms (Hunter, 2010: 26). Moreover, “the PT adopted a pro-labor and anti-foreign capital positions in its Constituent Assembly” (Hunter, 2010: 26). It even proposed the nationalization of the financial sector in 1989. The 1989 campaign was very much based on populist rhetoric. It was depicted as a struggle between “rich versus poor, exploiters versus exploited” and the solution was a radical rupture with the previous system (Hunter, 2010: 110). The PT fiercely criticized the status quo and rejected privatizations because they were seen as “delivering the national patrimony over to greedy domestic and foreign interests” (Hunter, 2010: 111). Additionally, Lula da Silva’s image, as an uncompromising “bearded labor leader in rolled-up sleeves” (Hunter, 2010: 111) signaled his opposition to traditional politicians.</p>
<p>Collor de Mello’s corruption and the economic hardship of the time encouraged the PT to continue with its oppositional politics and to present itself as proposing a radical departure from the existing order (Hunter, 2010: 117). Mentions to “transformation”, “revolution” and criticism of the “dominant classes” were common in the campaign and PT’s program concentrated on issues such as the external debt, land reform and privatizations (Hunter, 2010: 118). However, there was substantial moderation in the discourse, as Hunter (2010: 119) puts it “the zero-sum language of 1989 (e.g., the poor can only gain at the expense of the rich) gave way to the concept of ‘citizenship’” as a way of “guaranteeing basic rights to the population as a whole”. Although the possibility of a “third way” was rejected Lula, himself more moderate than the party, threatened to call off his candidacy if the radical trend the party was taken continued (Hunter, 2010: 121). In order to further his moderation, Lula chose Aloizio Mercandante as vice-president because of his links to the business world and to the military (Hunter, 2010: 121). I have coded 3 in Political Class, Financial Elite and Foreign Interest and Far Left in Ideology in 1994 and in all elections before.</p>
<p>In 1998, although Leonel Brizola ran with him as vice-president, Lula made an important change to the party’s rhetoric. The PT criticized Cardoso’s policies for exacerbating unemployment, but it did not propose any alternative model, nor did it question the need for privatizations beyond specific problems with the way they were being done (Hunter, 2010: 131). In addition, the PT abandoned the idea of the land reform and minimized the language around class struggle and dominant classes (Hunter, 2010: 132). Lula stressed its poor origins in order to connect with the people while downplaying his role as a labor leader (Hunter, 2010: 133). I have coded Left for Ideology in this election.</p>
<p>The biggest change, however, occurred with regards to the 2002 election. The words socialist or socialism did not appear in the 2002 manifesto and were replaced instead with the aim to “reform capitalism” and “democratize the market” (Hunter, 2010: 138). Lula wrote a “Letter to the Brazilian People” outside the margins of his party in which he pledged to maintain many of Cardoso’s policies, honor Brazil’s commitments with the IMF and keep a balanced budget (Hunter, 2010: 137). Furthermore, for the first time, the PT formed alliances with non-leftist parties. Jose Alencar, a businessman from the Liberal Party, was chosen to be Lula’s vice-president. Lastly, the change was not only one of moderation of policies, but of a different construction of the political leader. Confrontational politics were left aside to highlight Lula’s capacities as a competent, professional and experienced negotiator and politician (Hunter, 2010: 139). He was dressed in suits more often and one of the mottos of his campaign was “Lula, Peace and Love”. It is difficult to continue considering Lula as a populist in 2002. His campaign was ideological and rhetorically moderate and avoided the opposition between elites and the people that characterized his first campaigns. This does not mean that he was not committed to his leftist ideals, but that the discourse was not a populist one. I have decided, then, not to include the Workers Party in the database from 2002. From this election onwards, it is more analogous to a European socialist party than to a Latin American populist one. This applies as well to Dilma Rousseff’s time in government.</p>
<p>Lula’s popularity among the Brazilian electorate was PT’s biggest asset. He dominated all the presidential elections and was the undisputed leader of the party. In his path to moderation, moreover, he struggled to gain autonomy and independence from the party constrains. I have coded 3 in Personality Dependent. As an uneducated industrial worker and labor leader, Lula held no political power before the creation of the PT. I have thus, coded 1 for Insider Populism.</p>
<p>Lula strongly rejected the military dictatorship which made it very difficult for his party to be legally recognized in the 80s (Ortiz de Zarate, 2018). However, the military was not the main target of his discourse and he included the son of a military, Aloizio Mercandante, as his vice-president in 1994. Thus, I have coded 2 in all elections for Military.</p>
<p>Lula stressed the need to end corruption, rejected big business money and aimed at democratizing the market. Although his party become involved in several acts of corruption during his government which started in the 90s and he is now imprisoned for corruption as well, I have not found any explicit act aimed at violating LD norms throughout the 90s. I have labelled 1 for this category.</p>
</section>
<section id="democratic-labor-party" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="democratic-labor-party">Democratic Labor Party</h2>
<p>The PDT was founded by Leonel Brizola and participated in elections even before the restoration of civilian rule. Brizola is widely considered as an example of left-wing populist (Conniff, 1999). He had gained a reputation for aggressive and confrontational politics in 1961, when he organized a revolt to support João Goulart’s, his brother-in-law, ascension to power (Conniff, 1999: 55). He was mayor of Porto Alegre and governor of Rio Grande do Sul, but he did not formally participate in the national government. Given his connections to the president of Brazil and his importance as a figure among the left-wing political elite, I have coded 2 in Insider Populism.</p>
<p>He was well known for promoting land reform (Stédile, 2005), rent control and nationalization of utilities (Conniff, 1999: 55) and he gained a reputation as an “anti-Americanist and an enemy of foreign capital” (New York Times, 1962). When the democratic government was overthrown by the military, he flew to Uruguay, from where he supported insurrectionist politics against the military dictatorship (Needler, 1987: 84). He moderated somewhat his discourse when he came back to Brazil in the 80s and embraced a left-wing position within the constitutional democratic context and the market economy (Needler, 1987: 85). Brizola later became governor of Rio and was notable for “founding integrated schools centers for children, curbing police abuses and pressuring congress to hold direct elections for president in 1984” (Conniff, 1999: 58).</p>
<p>In 1998, he ran a campaign based on popular mobilization, condemnation of corruption and inequality and criticism of the media (Brizola, 1992). Brizola did not change his discourse in later years: “His political views remained almost unchanged since the 1960's. Until his death, he advocated a militant form of economic nationalism, liberal benefits for government employees and a generous education policy.” (Benson, 2004). In 1995, for example, he criticized Henrique Cardoso´s policies by saying that “if there is no civil reaction to privatization, there will be a military one” (Diamond et al., 2010: 49). Brizola ran for Vice-president with Lula in the 1994 elections and lost and later censured him for betraying his leftist politics. I have coded 3 in Political Class, Financial Elite and Foreign Interest, as well as 3 in Military due to his opposition to the dictatorship. Brizola was the undisputed leader of the PDT and ran as its candidate throughout the 90s (3 in Personality Dependent). Lastly, due to his insurrectional politics and harsh criticism of the media I have coded 2 in Violation of LD norms.</p>
<p>After Brizola’s death in 2004, the party held internal debated between those that defended continuity with Brizola’s politics and those wishing to adopt a more pragmatic and centrist stance and engage in collaboration with other parties (Ortiz de Zárate, 2018: 23). The party was slowly directed towards the second tendency. This is exemplified by the fact that they supported Dilma Rousseff for the 2010 and 2014 presidential elections. Moreover, in 2018, they chose Ciro Gomes, an experienced “center-left” politician (Sandy, 2018) that holds centrist macroeconomic policies (Schipani, 2018). I have not coded the party since the 2010 election because I do not believe it can still be considered populist.</p>
</section>
<section id="prona" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="prona">PRONA</h2>
<p>The Party of the Reconstruction of the National Order was founded by Enéas Carneiro and defended a far-right populist ideology. Carneiro said that his electoral support indicated a “resounding and unmistakable repudiation of a political class that is rotten, dirty, repugnant and unpatriotic” (Rother, 2002). He ran for president unsuccessfully in 1989, 1994 and 1998. He argued for the development of an atomic bomb (The Boston Globe, 2007) in order to secure Brazil’s position in the world and “remind Great Powers that we are continental nation that needs to be respected” (Rother, 2002). He added that “the same is true of the Armed Forces, and if elected, I will triple its size, they are the armed wing of the people” (Revista Isto É, 1998).</p>
<p>His political platform was clearly based on economic nationalism. He defended the industry and private initiative but opposed at the same time the neoliberal speculative model. In his own words: “One word only: nationalist. We defend private initiative; we want to give a huge boost to the national industry. We need our industrialist to survive and not become, little by little, a reseller of foreign product. I want our farmer to produce, and not, as now, to have to import beans. The old concept of the left is finished. But also, what there is on the right, which today is assimilated to the speculative neoliberal model, which we do not really want. Therefore, there is no way to define this new model: we are nationalists, we defend private initiative, industrial, agriculture, everyone who wants to produce” (Gomes, 1998). I believe this opposition to one version of the economic elite at the same time as it praises another deserves a 2 in Financial Elite.</p>
<p>Although immigration or ethnic others were not central topics in Carneiro’s discourse, his economic nationalist discourse linked the rejection of land gifts to indigenous communities with the rejection to foreign powers: “We condemn the intervention of one country in another, let each country solve its problems, I would say to the great powers: 'Leave us alone, leave our Amazon in peace.' Let's stop this story of giving a huge land, larger than Portugal, to half a dozen Indians. Let's end this internationalization story: the internationalized economy means, in other words: underdeveloped nations on their knees” (Carneiro, 1994). I have labelled 2 for immigrants and ethnic others and 3 for Foreign Interests.</p>
<p>Enéas attacked the media harshly by saying that “The government, the media, and the research institutes lie, lie sordidly. This tripod forms a great power. Terrible power. Malignant. And it suffocates the population” (Carneiro, 1994). Furthermore, he was strongly opposed to LGBT rights (Roda Vida, 1994). I have coded Violation of LD norms as a 3.</p>
<p>The party relied heavily on his persona. Carneiro had a long and distinctive beard and was famous for energetically shouting “My name is Enéas” at the end of his political ads. It was all part of the construction of a political character easily recognizable as distinct from the political elites. The party did not fare well in legislative elections where Enéas was not the candidate (3 in Personality Dependent).</p>
</section>
<section id="jair-bolsonaro" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="jair-bolsonaro">Jair Bolsonaro</h2>
<p>Jair Bolsonaro won the 2018 presidential election on a right-wing populist platform. He has been called the “Trump of the Tropics” (Phillips, 2018) due to its nationalist, homophobic, pro-gun and far right discourse.</p>
<p>Bolsonaro was an army captain which later entered into the National Congress. He was a member of the congress for more than 25 years and belonged to seven different parties before running for president. Although he is an experienced parliamentarian, he never held any position in government (1 in Insider Populism). In 2018, he joined the Social Liberal Party and ran for president. Given this constant movement between parties, it is clear that it is Bolsonaro’s figure what attracted voters (3 in Personality Dependent).</p>
<p>Bolsonaro has criticized politicians such as Lula and Dilma for their corruption and defended the need to restore the country to its former glory. On economic issues, Bolsonaro has been a defender of free-market policies and open borders: “He set out a pro-market direction as he promised to lower the tax burden on business and make the country more open to foreign trade” (Financial Times, 2019). Additionally, he has pushed for a business-friendly agenda by putting in place well-known investors like Paulo Guedes and a former Treasury secretary and World Bank economist Joaquim Levy in key positions in his government (Rapoza, 2019). On foreign policy, Bolsonaro “has repeatedly said he wants to bring closer Brazil to the United States and Israel ‘The Americans played an extraordinary role in our history, preventing us from turning to Cuba in 1964’” (Manchikoni, 2018). However, he also bashed China, arguing that the Asian country did not just buy in Brazil but was, in fact, buying Brazil itself (Jingtao, 2019). Additionally, he has censored international NGO’s actions in his country: “This cowardly business of international NGOs like WWF and so many others from England sticking their noses into Brazil is going to end! This tomfoolery stops right here!” (Phillips, 2018a). I have coded 1 for Financial Elite and 2 for Foreign Interests.</p>
<p>Bolsonaro has repeatedly made comments against non-white ethnic communities. He claimed, for example, that “people living in reservations were ‘parasites’, that ‘quilombolas’ (black community members, descendants of runaway slaves) ‘weren't even fit for breeding’, that NGOs and social movements were stealing the country's resources, and that the only way to fight crime was handing out guns to the population” (Henrique Leal, 2017). Furthermore, he stated that the Funai (the National Indigenous Foundation) deliberately chose the “richest and most fertile” lands to “give away” to “Indians and blacks”, while stealing land from whites who had been “living there for centuries” (Henrique Leal, 2017). Bolsonaro is also famous for his religious nationalism. His campaign slogan was ““Brazil above everything, God above everyone” (The Economist, 2017). Previously, he had made remarks on the Christian identity of Brazil which Henrique Leal (2017) describes in the following way: “According to Bolsonaro, since Brazil is ‘a Christian country’, non-Christians should stay out of political life - as they are not ‘true citizens’. Islam and African religions should be banned, as they are antithetical to the ‘national faith’ and operate as an ‘open door to terrorists’”. I have labelled 3 for Immigrants and Ethnic Others.</p>
<p>Sexism is also one of Bolsonao’s trademarks. He famously said that “the only reason he didn’t rape” a congresswoman was “because she didn’t deserve it” because “she was too ugly” (Henrique Leal, 2017). Bolsonaro employs a similar marketing strategy to that of Donald Trump based on stating widely polemic comments to attract attention and an intensive use of social media to bypass traditional means of communication (considered by him as “fake news”).</p>
<p>Bolsonaro has a favorable stance towards Brazil’s former military dictatorship. In 1996, he explicitly said he was “in favor of a dictatorship” (Brooke, 1993) and in 2016, he dedicated his impeachment vote against Dilma Rousseff (who suffered torture during the military regime) to Carlos Alberto Brilhante Ustra, a famous torturer (The Economist, 2017). It is common to see him carrying guns and military symbolism is abundant in his rallies. In a rally shortly before the second round of the presidential election, he threatened to purge leftist outlaws and banish them from the country (Phillips, 2018b). Thus, I have coded 1 in Military and 3 in Violation of LD norms.</p>
