## Bulgarian Business Bloc

The Bulgarian Business Bloc (*Bulgarski biznes blok*, BBB) was founded
to defend business interests in the early 1990s (KosovÃ¡ 2022, 370).
Although not created by him, the party became totally dependent on its
1992 presidential candidate George Ganchev (Lessenski 2020, 45; Zankina
2016, 196; Georgi Karasimeonov 1995, 583), a flamboyant businessman who
had lived abroad (CHARISMA = 3). Ganchev placed third in that election
with 16.78%, and reached 21.9 in the 1996 presidential election. The BBB
won 5.27% of the vote in the 1997 parliamentary election. Ganchev split
from the party to form the George Ganchev Bloc for the 2001
parliamentary elections, at which both entities polled poorly.

Ganchev's campaign was light on programmatic policy, but heavy on
criticism of the political class, both sides of which he alleged to be
equally corrupt, dishonest and incompetent (Levitt and Kostadinova 2014,
529). In Cristova's words:

> For the first time, the bifurcation and polarization in political
> discourse were superseded by an indiscriminate attack on the political
> elite altogether. His rhetorics witnessed an emergent attack on
> parliamentary democracy, which was testified in his depiction of
> deputies as "liars in parliament" (Cristova 2010, 223)

Other literature has labelled him a "protest candidate" (Bastian 1998,
192) and an "opportunist" (Georgi Karasimeonov 1995, 583). On this basis
we've coded him 3 on (OTH_POLCLASS = 3)

Other than this anti-politician rhetoric, we cannot see any evidence
that the campaigns of Ganchev or BBB should register on the
OTH_IMMIGRANT, OTH_ETHNIC, OTH_MILITARY, or OTH_FOREIGN, even though
Ganchev was a strident nationalist (Georgi Karasimeonov 1995, 583), and
the party was generally right wing (LRPOSITION = R). We've also seen no
evidence that Ganchev was a participant in previous governments (INSIDER
= 1), or that his campaign violated liberal democratic norms
(LIBDEMNORMS = 1).

## National Movement -- Simeon II

In 2001, the former King Simeon Saxe-Goburg-Gotha (who served as a child
monarch during WWII) ran a reformist campaign that is widely referred to
as populist (see for example Raycheva and Peicheva 2020, 76). This was
furnished with a new party, the National Movement - Simeon Second /
NMSS). Simeon's campaign was a mixture of royal nostalgia, frustration
with the political class, and the promise of an immediate improvement in
living conditions (Cristova 2010, 224). It was based exclusively on the
charisma of Simeon himself (G Karasimeonov and Lyubenov 2013, 413; Gurov
and Zankina 2013, 5) (CHARISMA = 3). Simeon's OTH_POLCLASS rhetoric was
somewhat "softer" (Smilov and Krastev 2008, 9) than other populists in
Bulgara, given that he promised to work with rivals transcend the
pettiness of the current party system. Nonetheless, his campaign did
paint a picture of the elite as enjoying "inexplicable richness" while
the people suffered (Cristova 2010, 224), and presented a totally
non-ideological and binary representation of the people and the elite
(Smilov and Krastev 2008, 16; Gurov and Zankina 2013, 5), justifying at
least a 2 on this variable.

We have seen no evidence of any other relevant OTH\_ variable, and
despite his status as a former monarch, he was not any kind of INSIDER
when he ran. Simeon's transcendent image became diluted in office as he
acted in increasingly partisan ways, and by the time he ran for
re-election he did not present any populist traits at all (Cholova 2012,
78; Van Kessel 2015, 39).

## Attack

While Ganchev had attempted a kind of right wing populism in the early
1990s, the first true far right populist party, Attack (*Ataka*),
emerged in 2005 led by journalist Volen Siderov and based on his cable
TV program of the same name. Attack utilised an extreme ethnocentric
rhetoric as a rallying cry to disaffected voters, advocating "to take
our Bulgaria back for the Bulgarians" (Ghodsee 2008, 30). The country
allegedly needed to be taken "back" from a range of enemies, among them
ethnic minorities such as Jews, Roma and Turks (Mestan 2022) (OTH_ETHNIC
= 3).

It also utilised a radical anti-establishment rhetoric (Stoyanov and
Kostadinova 2021, 230), claiming to represent the people as a whole
(Smilov and Krastev 2008, 17), in opposition to a corrupt and
self-serving elite. In Siderov's maiden parliamentary speech, he claimed
that "the Bulgarian people have been aroused and have deafeningly
slapped the face of the so-called political class that has long turned
into a herd of grunting pigs, into unfeeling balls of lard, deaf to the
problems and the suffering of their own people" (Ghodsee 2008, 31). It
also utilised an anti-globalist against the influence of the US (which
Siderov considered to be controlled by Jews, (Ghodsee 2008, 32)), NATO,
the World Bank and the IMF (Cristova 2010, 225), and the EU
(OTH_FOREIGN=3). We could not find any specific references to
anti-immigrant rhetoric in the years in which Ataka is included in the
dataset (OTH_IMMIGRANTS = 1), although this could be investigated
further. We've coded the party's OTH_FINANCIAL rhetoric 2 given that it
seems to be an extension of OTH_POLCLASS and OTH_FOREIGN rhetoric rather
than opposition to businesses and the wealthy *per se* (Ghodsee 2008).

The party was dominated by the personality of Siderov (Ghodsee 2008, 32)
(CHARISMA = 3), and given its occasionally violent rhetoric and actions
it also deserves a 3 on LIBDEMNORMS. The party's core left-right
ideology is a hotly debated subject. While it presents the nativism and
ethnocentrism typical of far-right parties, it also presents a programme
critical of neo-liberalism, in particular the privatisation of state
assets to political cronies and foreign powers. It has also advocated
higher spending on welfare and social programs. Raycheva and Peicheva
claim that the party's ideology is a combination of "extremist
right-wing with extreme left-wing ideas" (Raycheva and Peicheva 2020,
75). Given the salience of the party's ethnonationalism, we've coded it
FR. Cholova has suggested that the party moderated its image around 2009
in order to drop its pariah status (Cholova 2012, 78), but we cannot see
enough evidence for a change on any of these variables. Further research
should confirm this.

## GERB

The strongest populist party since Simeon has been the centre-right GERB
(Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria) founded by the popular
mayor of Sofia (and former bodyguard) Boyko Borisov. The party is built
around Borisov's crass man-of-the-people appeal in a similar way to
Ganchev in the 1990s, with his main criticism being corruption and ties
to organised crime in existing governments (Cristova 2010, 225; Cholova
2012, 85). GERB achieved remarkable success in taking the place of the
SDS and NMSS as the dominant centre right party from 2009 and as a
result Borisov has dominated national politics in various coalitions for
the past decade, weathering a storm of protests that saw him temporarily
resign in 2013.

While he is generally right wing (LRPOSITION = CR), Borisov's ideology
was kept quite vague (Gurov and Zankina 2013, 6; Smilov 2008, 19). His
hostility to the political class is rooted in allegations of corruption
and incompetance -- alleging for example that Parliament was full of
"liars" and losers" (Cristova 2010, 226) -- particularly in relation to
their inability to tackle organised crime (Cholova 2012, 85). He
therefore "portrayed himself as a man of the people fighting against the
corrupt elite" (G Karasimeonov and Lyubenov 2013, 415). It is however
debatable whether Borisov and GERB deserve a 2 or a 3 in OTH_POLCLASS.
There is reason to believe that his anti-politician rhetoric was not as
strong as others in Bulgaria at the time -- in part due to the fact that
Borisov was himself connected to previous governments, and had an
interest in eschewing the 'populist' label (G Karasimeonov and Lyubenov
2013, 415). While this could be further researched (particularly whether
it has changed over time), we've labelled it 3 here.

Borisov is also pro-European, and it is not evident from my reading that
OTH_ETHNIC politics is prominent in his populism. Likewise, OTH_FOREIGN
rhetoric does not seem to be significant part of his platform, nor is
OTH_FINANCIAL given that the party generally promotes a sound business
environment in its policies and platforms (Cholova 2012, 87). It is
difficult to code the party on OTH_IMMIGRANT. Immigration has not been a
salient political topic in Bulgaria until very recently, and much of the
criticism GERB receives on the issue seems to have more to do with its
choice of far right coalition parties rather then rhetoric emanating
from Boyko himself. We've kept the coding at 1 in elections since 2014,
further research should confirm this.

The party was and is entirely built around the down-to-earth tough guy
personality of Borisov (Cristova 2010, 226; Smilov 2008, 19)
(CHARISMA=3). As opposed to the regal and high-minded Simeon, this was
rooted in a common man persona honed by skilled media performances and
the personalisation of public policy (Ganev 2018, 99). According to
Gurov and Zankina Borisov "shares the popular dislike of institutions
and the bureaucracy, labeling entire socio-occupational
categories---such as judges or parliamentary deputies---inefficient and
corrupt," and rarely complies with constitutional constraints on his
executive power (Gurov and Zankina 2013, 9). The government has also
pressured state TV to supress voices critical of GERB (Ganev 2018, 96).
However, it is not clear from research that this hostility to democratic
institutions constitutes a wholesale threat to democracy on the scale of
Attack (LIBDEMNORMS = 2). Given that Borisov was the head of the police
under Simeon II (Smilov 2008, 19), We have coded him 2 for INSIDER in
his first election in 2009 and 3 in all others after forming government.

## Patriotic Front/ United Patriots 

Two far-right parties smaller than Ataka, the National Front for the
Salvation of Bulgaria (NFSB) and IMRO Bulgarian National Movement
(IMRO-BNM), formed a coalition for the 2014 elections called "Patriotic
Front" (PF). NFSB is led by Valeri Simeonov, a media mogul who was once
closely aligned with Attack's leader Siderov before the two fell out
bitterly (Simeonov is the owner of the SKAT cable TV station that
Siderov's original "Attack" program aired on). The IMRO has a more
independent history, and could be considered somewhat more moderate than
Attack, although not to the point of changing any of its coding here.
The coalition received 7.28% in 2014, and was organised around a program
highly similar to Attack's. After seeing its own vote decline in
comparison to the PF, Attack decided to join the group (previously
bitter rivals) for the 2017 elections under the name United Patriots
(UP), winning 15%.

While there are some differences between the three parties in this
coalition, we have not seen any evidence to code PF or UP any
differently to Attack, except for on the OTH_IMMIGRANT variable. This is
not due to outlook as much as context: immigration was not a salient
political issue in Bulgaria until the Syrian refugee crisis made it so
(Weisskircher and Rone 2016, 2).
