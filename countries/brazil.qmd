Brazil was controlled by the military for more than twenty years, from
1964 until 1985. In 1985 José Sarney was elected to the presidency of
Brazil and initiated the transition process. A new constitution was
drafted in 1988 and the first direct presidential elections were held in
1989. Three populist candidates competed in those elections: Fernando
Collor de Mello, Luis Inácio Lula da Silva and Leonel Brizola.

## Fernando Collor de Mello

Collor de Mello was a member of an important family in Brazil and had
been elected as mayor of Maceió and governor of the province of Alagoas
before running for president. He held no position of relevance in the
previous regime and was little known to the public before 1989. Coming
from a underdeveloped and impoverished region, Collor de Mello run a
campaign as an outsider differentiating himself from traditional
politicians (Panizza, 2000: 181). He engineered a modern communication's
campaign based entirely on his personal figure (he ran for a small and
not well-known political party). His campaign surpassed the traditional
right-wing candidate and then defeated Lula's party in the second round.
I have coded 1 for Insider Populism and 3 for Personality Dependent.

Callor de Mello based his campaign in fighting against corruption,
criticizing in particular the "marajás" (high ranked civil servants)
(Noielli, 2008). As Panizza puts it, "he was uncompromising in his
attacks against the state's bureaucracy, the political establishment
and, particularly, against President Sarney" (Panizza, 2000: 182). He
viewed the restoration of social order as a moral crusade against the
"privileged political and economic elite that had become rich at the
expense of the poor" (Panizza, 2000: 182). Collor de Mello claimed that
he aimed "to make the right indignant and leave the left perplexed" and
he even rejected endorsement by business groups (Panizza, 2000:
182-183). He defended the need to implement neoliberal policies in order
to reduce the hyperinflation that the country suffered at the moment
(Noielli, 2008) and he liberalized and opened the economy by drastically
lowering the import tariffs (Panizza, 2000: 185). Collor de Mello was
supported by important TV companies and right-wing groups of Brazil
which wished to stop the rise of Lula (Ortiz de Zárate, 2016). I
labelled 3 for Political Class and Financial Elite, "Right" for ideology
and, given his desire to liberalize and open the economy against the
wishes of a fraction of Brazil's industrial elite, 1 in Foreign
Interests.

Collor de Mello implemented a number of shock policies designed to
liberalize the country, reduce hyperinflation and break with the
previous statist model of economic development (Panizza, 2000: 185). In
line with his populist and personalist style, he also attempted to run
with the support of the public opinion but without the backing of a
stable party alliance. Panizza describes it in the following way: "Once
in office, Collor faced two options: he could either radicalize the
'politics of anti-politics' campaign and refuse to acknowledge the
legitimacy of the existing political establishment or, alternatively,
become immersed in the political game, thus losing his status as
political outsider. Eventually, Collor fell between two stools"
(Panizza, 2000: 187-188). When his economic policies failed and he was
accused of corruption by his own brother, the congress decided to
impeach him. He resigned just before the impeachment, but congress
incapacitated him for office for 8 years. Therefore, although Collor de
Mello did not take the authoritarian route of Fujimori in Peru, he
engaged in extensive corruption and refused to collaborate with parties
in the parliament. I believe this should deserve a 2 in Violation of LD
norms. I have not been able to find any negative discourse of
immigrants, the military or ethnic others.

## Workers' Party

The Workers' Party is the most important party in Brazilian politics of
the last decades. It was founded by a group of academics, intellectuals
and union leaders led by Luis Inácio Lula da Silva, a popular union
leader with no formal educational background. The party had a strong
support base among labor unions and its organizational structure was
that of a mass bureaucratic party (Hunter, 2010: 22). The party fits
better in the classification of a socialist party than in a populist
one, particularly when compared to a clear left-wing populist party such
as Brizola's PDT. Conniff (1999: 59) stated that Lula "could not even
remotely be called populist" but Zedillo (2002: 55) argued that Lula ran
on a populist platform. Lula da Silva ran unsuccessfully as a
presidential candidate in 1989, 1994, 1998 and finally won in 2002.
During this time, the party went through an important transformation in
its discourse moderating its radicalism with every electoral bid
(Hunter, 2010: 60).

The party's platform was rooted in achieving socialism and in an
opposition to trade liberalization, labor 'flexibilization' and
neoliberal reforms (Hunter, 2010: 26). Moreover, "the PT adopted a
pro-labor and anti-foreign capital positions in its Constituent
Assembly" (Hunter, 2010: 26). It even proposed the nationalization of
the financial sector in 1989. The 1989 campaign was very much based on
populist rhetoric. It was depicted as a struggle between "rich versus
poor, exploiters versus exploited" and the solution was a radical
rupture with the previous system (Hunter, 2010: 110). The PT fiercely
criticized the status quo and rejected privatizations because they were
seen as "delivering the national patrimony over to greedy domestic and
foreign interests" (Hunter, 2010: 111). Additionally, Lula da Silva's
image, as an uncompromising "bearded labor leader in rolled-up sleeves"
(Hunter, 2010: 111) signaled his opposition to traditional politicians.

Collor de Mello's corruption and the economic hardship of the time
encouraged the PT to continue with its oppositional politics and to
present itself as proposing a radical departure from the existing order
(Hunter, 2010: 117). Mentions to "transformation", "revolution" and
criticism of the "dominant classes" were common in the campaign and PT's
program concentrated on issues such as the external debt, land reform
and privatizations (Hunter, 2010: 118). However, there was substantial
moderation in the discourse, as Hunter (2010: 119) puts it "the zero-sum
language of 1989 (e.g., the poor can only gain at the expense of the
rich) gave way to the concept of 'citizenship'" as a way of
"guaranteeing basic rights to the population as a whole". Although the
possibility of a "third way" was rejected Lula, himself more moderate
than the party, threatened to call off his candidacy if the radical
trend the party was taken continued (Hunter, 2010: 121). In order to
further his moderation, Lula chose Aloizio Mercandante as vice-president
because of his links to the business world and to the military (Hunter,
2010: 121). I have coded 3 in Political Class, Financial Elite and
Foreign Interest and Far Left in Ideology in 1994 and in all elections
before.

In 1998, although Leonel Brizola ran with him as vice-president, Lula
made an important change to the party's rhetoric. The PT criticized
Cardoso's policies for exacerbating unemployment, but it did not propose
any alternative model, nor did it question the need for privatizations
beyond specific problems with the way they were being done (Hunter,
2010: 131). In addition, the PT abandoned the idea of the land reform
and minimized the language around class struggle and dominant classes
(Hunter, 2010: 132). Lula stressed its poor origins in order to connect
with the people while downplaying his role as a labor leader (Hunter,
2010: 133). I have coded Left for Ideology in this election.

The biggest change, however, occurred with regards to the 2002 election.
The words socialist or socialism did not appear in the 2002 manifesto
and were replaced instead with the aim to "reform capitalism" and
"democratize the market" (Hunter, 2010: 138). Lula wrote a "Letter to
the Brazilian People" outside the margins of his party in which he
pledged to maintain many of Cardoso's policies, honor Brazil's
commitments with the IMF and keep a balanced budget (Hunter, 2010: 137).
Furthermore, for the first time, the PT formed alliances with
non-leftist parties. Jose Alencar, a businessman from the Liberal Party,
was chosen to be Lula's vice-president. Lastly, the change was not only
one of moderation of policies, but of a different construction of the
political leader. Confrontational politics were left aside to highlight
Lula's capacities as a competent, professional and experienced
negotiator and politician (Hunter, 2010: 139). He was dressed in suits
more often and one of the mottos of his campaign was "Lula, Peace and
Love". It is difficult to continue considering Lula as a populist in
2002. His campaign was ideological and rhetorically moderate and avoided
the opposition between elites and the people that characterized his
first campaigns. This does not mean that he was not committed to his
leftist ideals, but that the discourse was not a populist one. I have
decided, then, not to include the Workers Party in the database from
2002. From this election onwards, it is more analogous to a European
socialist party than to a Latin American populist one. This applies as
well to Dilma Rousseff's time in government.

Lula's popularity among the Brazilian electorate was PT's biggest asset.
He dominated all the presidential elections and was the undisputed
leader of the party. In his path to moderation, moreover, he struggled
to gain autonomy and independence from the party constrains. I have
coded 3 in Personality Dependent. As an uneducated industrial worker and
labor leader, Lula held no political power before the creation of the
PT. I have thus, coded 1 for Insider Populism.

Lula strongly rejected the military dictatorship which made it very
difficult for his party to be legally recognized in the 80s (Ortiz de
Zarate, 2018). However, the military was not the main target of his
discourse and he included the son of a military, Aloizio Mercandante, as
his vice-president in 1994. Thus, I have coded 2 in all elections for
Military.

Lula stressed the need to end corruption, rejected big business money
and aimed at democratizing the market. Although his party become
involved in several acts of corruption during his government which
started in the 90s and he is now imprisoned for corruption as well, I
have not found any explicit act aimed at violating LD norms throughout
the 90s. I have labelled 1 for this category.

## Democratic Labor Party

The PDT was founded by Leonel Brizola and participated in elections even
before the restoration of civilian rule. Brizola is widely considered as
an example of left-wing populist (Conniff, 1999). He had gained a
reputation for aggressive and confrontational politics in 1961, when he
organized a revolt to support João Goulart's, his brother-in-law,
ascension to power (Conniff, 1999: 55). He was mayor of Porto Alegre and
governor of Rio Grande do Sul, but he did not formally participate in
the national government. Given his connections to the president of
Brazil and his importance as a figure among the left-wing political
elite, I have coded 2 in Insider Populism.

He was well known for promoting land reform (Stédile, 2005), rent
control and nationalization of utilities (Conniff, 1999: 55) and he
gained a reputation as an "anti-Americanist and an enemy of foreign
capital" (New York Times, 1962). When the democratic government was
overthrown by the military, he flew to Uruguay, from where he supported
insurrectionist politics against the military dictatorship (Needler,
1987: 84). He moderated somewhat his discourse when he came back to
Brazil in the 80s and embraced a left-wing position within the
constitutional democratic context and the market economy (Needler, 1987:
85). Brizola later became governor of Rio and was notable for "founding
integrated schools centers for children, curbing police abuses and
pressuring congress to hold direct elections for president in 1984"
(Conniff, 1999: 58).

In 1998, he ran a campaign based on popular mobilization, condemnation
of corruption and inequality and criticism of the media (Brizola, 1992).
Brizola did not change his discourse in later years: "His political
views remained almost unchanged since the 1960\'s. Until his death, he
advocated a militant form of economic nationalism, liberal benefits for
government employees and a generous education policy." (Benson, 2004).
In 1995, for example, he criticized Henrique Cardoso´s policies by
saying that "if there is no civil reaction to privatization, there will
be a military one" (Diamond et al., 2010: 49). Brizola ran for
Vice-president with Lula in the 1994 elections and lost and later
censured him for betraying his leftist politics. I have coded 3 in
Political Class, Financial Elite and Foreign Interest, as well as 3 in
Military due to his opposition to the dictatorship. Brizola was the
undisputed leader of the PDT and ran as its candidate throughout the 90s
(3 in Personality Dependent). Lastly, due to his insurrectional politics
and harsh criticism of the media I have coded 2 in Violation of LD
norms.

After Brizola's death in 2004, the party held internal debated between
those that defended continuity with Brizola's politics and those wishing
to adopt a more pragmatic and centrist stance and engage in
collaboration with other parties (Ortiz de Zárate, 2018: 23). The party
was slowly directed towards the second tendency. This is exemplified by
the fact that they supported Dilma Rousseff for the 2010 and 2014
presidential elections. Moreover, in 2018, they chose Ciro Gomes, an
experienced "center-left" politician (Sandy, 2018) that holds centrist
macroeconomic policies (Schipani, 2018). I have not coded the party
since the 2010 election because I do not believe it can still be
considered populist.

## PRONA

The Party of the Reconstruction of the National Order was founded by
Enéas Carneiro and defended a far-right populist ideology. Carneiro said
that his electoral support indicated a "resounding and unmistakable
repudiation of a political class that is rotten, dirty, repugnant and
unpatriotic" (Rother, 2002). He ran for president unsuccessfully in
1989, 1994 and 1998. He argued for the development of an atomic bomb
(The Boston Globe, 2007) in order to secure Brazil's position in the
world and "remind Great Powers that we are continental nation that needs
to be respected" (Rother, 2002). He added that "the same is true of the
Armed Forces, and if elected, I will triple its size, they are the armed
wing of the people" (Revista Isto É, 1998).

His political platform was clearly based on economic nationalism. He
defended the industry and private initiative but opposed at the same
time the neoliberal speculative model. In his own words: "One word only:
nationalist. We defend private initiative; we want to give a huge boost
to the national industry. We need our industrialist to survive and not
become, little by little, a reseller of foreign product. I want our
farmer to produce, and not, as now, to have to import beans. The old
concept of the left is finished. But also, what there is on the right,
which today is assimilated to the speculative neoliberal model, which we
do not really want. Therefore, there is no way to define this new model:
we are nationalists, we defend private initiative, industrial,
agriculture, everyone who wants to produce" (Gomes, 1998). I believe
this opposition to one version of the economic elite at the same time as
it praises another deserves a 2 in Financial Elite.

Although immigration or ethnic others were not central topics in
Carneiro's discourse, his economic nationalist discourse linked the
rejection of land gifts to indigenous communities with the rejection to
foreign powers: "We condemn the intervention of one country in another,
let each country solve its problems, I would say to the great powers:
\'Leave us alone, leave our Amazon in peace.\' Let\'s stop this story of
giving a huge land, larger than Portugal, to half a dozen Indians.
Let\'s end this internationalization story: the internationalized
economy means, in other words: underdeveloped nations on their knees"
(Carneiro, 1994). I have labelled 2 for immigrants and ethnic others and
3 for Foreign Interests.

Enéas attacked the media harshly by saying that "The government, the
media, and the research institutes lie, lie sordidly. This tripod forms
a great power. Terrible power. Malignant. And it suffocates the
population" (Carneiro, 1994). Furthermore, he was strongly opposed to
LGBT rights (Roda Vida, 1994). I have coded Violation of LD norms as a
3.

The party relied heavily on his persona. Carneiro had a long and
distinctive beard and was famous for energetically shouting "My name is
Enéas" at the end of his political ads. It was all part of the
construction of a political character easily recognizable as distinct
from the political elites. The party did not fare well in legislative
elections where Enéas was not the candidate (3 in Personality
Dependent).

## Jair Bolsonaro 

Jair Bolsonaro won the 2018 presidential election on a right-wing
populist platform. He has been called the "Trump of the Tropics"
(Phillips, 2018) due to its nationalist, homophobic, pro-gun and far
right discourse.

Bolsonaro was an army captain which later entered into the National
Congress. He was a member of the congress for more than 25 years and
belonged to seven different parties before running for president.
Although he is an experienced parliamentarian, he never held any
position in government (1 in Insider Populism). In 2018, he joined the
Social Liberal Party and ran for president. Given this constant movement
between parties, it is clear that it is Bolsonaro's figure what
attracted voters (3 in Personality Dependent).

Bolsonaro has criticized politicians such as Lula and Dilma for their
corruption and defended the need to restore the country to its former
glory. On economic issues, Bolsonaro has been a defender of free-market
policies and open borders: "He set out a pro-market direction as he
promised to lower the tax burden on business and make the country more
open to foreign trade" (Financial Times, 2019). Additionally, he has
pushed for a business-friendly agenda by putting in place well-known
investors like Paulo Guedes and a former Treasury secretary and World
Bank economist Joaquim Levy in key positions in his government (Rapoza,
2019). On foreign policy, Bolsonaro "has repeatedly said he wants to
bring closer Brazil to the United States and Israel 'The Americans
played an extraordinary role in our history, preventing us from turning
to Cuba in 1964'" (Manchikoni, 2018). However, he also bashed China,
arguing that the Asian country did not just buy in Brazil but was, in
fact, buying Brazil itself (Jingtao, 2019). Additionally, he has
censored international NGO's actions in his country: "This cowardly
business of international NGOs like WWF and so many others from England
sticking their noses into Brazil is going to end! This tomfoolery stops
right here!" (Phillips, 2018a). I have coded 1 for Financial Elite and 2
for Foreign Interests.

Bolsonaro has repeatedly made comments against non-white ethnic
communities. He claimed, for example, that "people living in
reservations were 'parasites', that 'quilombolas' (black community
members, descendants of runaway slaves) 'weren\'t even fit for
breeding', that NGOs and social movements were stealing the country\'s
resources, and that the only way to fight crime was handing out guns to
the population" (Henrique Leal, 2017). Furthermore, he stated that the
Funai (the National Indigenous Foundation) deliberately chose the
"richest and most fertile" lands to "give away" to "Indians and blacks",
while stealing land from whites who had been "living there for
centuries" (Henrique Leal, 2017). Bolsonaro is also famous for his
religious nationalism. His campaign slogan was ""Brazil above
everything, God above everyone" (The Economist, 2017). Previously, he
had made remarks on the Christian identity of Brazil which Henrique Leal
(2017) describes in the following way: "According to Bolsonaro, since
Brazil is 'a Christian country', non-Christians should stay out of
political life - as they are not 'true citizens'. Islam and African
religions should be banned, as they are antithetical to the 'national
faith' and operate as an 'open door to terrorists'". I have labelled 3
for Immigrants and Ethnic Others.

Sexism is also one of Bolsonao's trademarks. He famously said that "the
only reason he didn't rape" a congresswoman was "because she didn't
deserve it" because "she was too ugly" (Henrique Leal, 2017). Bolsonaro
employs a similar marketing strategy to that of Donald Trump based on
stating widely polemic comments to attract attention and an intensive
use of social media to bypass traditional means of communication
(considered by him as "fake news").

Bolsonaro has a favorable stance towards Brazil's former military
dictatorship. In 1996, he explicitly said he was "in favor of a
dictatorship" (Brooke, 1993) and in 2016, he dedicated his impeachment
vote against Dilma Rousseff (who suffered torture during the military
regime) to Carlos Alberto Brilhante Ustra, a famous torturer (The
Economist, 2017). It is common to see him carrying guns and military
symbolism is abundant in his rallies. In a rally shortly before the
second round of the presidential election, he threatened to purge
leftist outlaws and banish them from the country (Phillips, 2018b).
Thus, I have coded 1 in Military and 3 in Violation of LD norms.
