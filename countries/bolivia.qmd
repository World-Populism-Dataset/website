Bolivia was ruled by a dictatorship since 1964 when, in 1978, General
Padilla staged a coup d'état against the ruling military leaders and
called for elections in July 1979. Since no candidate won more than 51%
of the vote, Walter Guevara, the president of the Senate, was invested
president. In November of that same year, General Natusch staged another
coup d´état but a popular insurrection made it fail two weeks later.
Lidia Gueiler, president of the Congress, was elected president and new
elections were held in June 1980. Hernán Siles Zuazo was the most voted
candidate but he could not be elected president because a third coup
d'état, perpetrated by General García Meza, took place. The new military
dictatorship continued until 1982, when massive strikes triggered its
fall. The elections of 1980 were considered legitimate and Siles Zuazo
was elected president in 1982.

Until the victory of Evo Morales in 2006, three parties dominated
Bolivian politics: the Revolutionary Nationalist Movement, Nationalist
Democratic Action and Revolutionary Left Movement. Since the Bolivian
system makes it difficult for any party to obtain a majority,
governments have traditionally been decided through various agreements
between these three parties. The lack of perception of a clear
alternative within these political options aided in the development of
populist parties in Bolivia in the 90's and 2000's. Barr (2017: 83), Van
Cott (2007), Madrid (2012) and Mayorga (2003) agree upon identifying
CONDEPA, UCS and MAS as the main populist parties in Bolivia since the
reinstatement of democracy.

## CONDEPA

The history of CONDEPA is dependent on the evolution of its leader,
Carlos Palenque. Palenque started his career as a musician of a group
that introduced popular indigenous rhythms in their songs and later
became a very successful TV host. One of his most famous programs
consisted in hearing the complaints and everyday stories of mainly
indigenous peoples, an activity he combined with social and
philanthropic actions. He always claimed his was the "radio of the
people" (Alenda Mary, 2002: 89) and gained fame as the "compadre" a term
which refers to a father figure for those that needed it the most
(Mayorga, 2003: 106). His involvement in politics started when the
government decided to close all of Palenque's media outlets because of
an interview in which the president was accused of being related to drug
trafficking. A massive popular mobilization protested the closure of the
radios and, in response, Palenque, who had very little previous
experience in politics, created CONDEPA or Conscience of Fatherland (1
in Insider Populism).

CONDEPA was largely based on the messianic charisma of Palenque, who
used to dress and talk in popular ways in order to differentiate himself
from other politicians (3 in Charisma). Van Cott (2007: 85) identifies
CONDEPA with the left and its rhetoric aimed at establishing an
emotional connection with the electorate (Mayorga, 2003: 109). He ran a
platform based on the protection of the marginal sectors of society by
the state and the defense of national resources (Plano Medio, 2011).
Madrid explains the political platform of the party in the following
way:

> CONDEPA, Perú Posible, and the PNP have employed populist appeals to
> an even greater extent than ethnic appeals. They have run campaigns
> centered on the personal characteristics of their leaders, rather than
> on the parties or their programs. They have employed
> anti-establishment messages, presenting their leaders as political
> outsiders and as honest and grassroots alternatives to the corrupt
> traditional politicians. And they have focused their appeals primarily
> on the lower classes. They have forged alliances with numerous
> working-class groups from peasant associations to unions, informal
> sector organizations, and neighborhood groups. The leaders of these
> parties have adopted a popular, at times folksy, style of campaigning,
> and much of their discourse has centered on meeting the needs of
> disadvantaged and neglected sectors of the population. Some of the
> mestizo-led parties, such as CONDEPA and the PNP, have also made
> nationalist and state interventionist appeals, denouncing neo-liberal
> policies and U.S. intervention. (Madrid, 2012: 29)

In fact, Palenque opposed the liberalizing measures that the government
was implementing because he defended an "endogenous model" which would
make Bolivia self-sufficient with its own resources (Plano Medio, 2011).
I have, thus, coded CONDEPA as 3 in Political Class, Financial Class and
Foreign Interest and Left-wing as its ideology.

The indigenous element is fundamental to CONDEPA's platform. Himself a
mestizo (Madrid, 2012: 48), Palenque appealed to the Aymara community
and often invoked Aymara sayings and traditions (Alenda Mary, 2002). His
support base was basically composed of indigenous people that lived
around La Paz (Madrid, 2012: 29). Moreover, his party was the first in
electing a "chola" (indigenous woman) to the Bolivian Parliament. Since
I have not found any anti-immigrant rhetoric, I have coded 1 for Ethnic
Others and Immigration.

Following Panebianco, Mayorga (2003: 111) describes CONDEPA as a
'charismatic party' whose functioning was based on loyalty to the leader
and the subordination of formal rules to the personal and familial links
to Palenque (Mayorga, 2003: 113). Since the figure of the leader is
stressed in all the texts that addressed CONDEPA, I have coded 3 for
Charisma.

I have neither found claims against the military nor any violation of
established LD norms. In fact, despite their rhetoric, Mayorga (2003:
115) claims that "their emergence did not call into question the
democratic regime because they soon participated in the logic of
post-electoral deals that characterized the access to national and
municipal governments". Thus, they reached agreements with some of the
so-called "neoliberal parties" and did not threaten the usual way of
forming governments in Bolivia (1 in Military and LD Norms).

CONDEPA's biggest challenge was faced in 1997 when, just a couple of
months before the elections, Carlos Palenque suddenly died. He was
substituted by Remedios Loza, the first 'chola' to enter the Bolivian
parliament. Loza had been with Palenque since his time in the radio and
she was known as the "comadre", the female equivalent to the "compadre".
Loza exhibited a clear continuist line with the politics and proposals
of Palenque (Alenda Mary, 116). "The credibility of the succession oath
that Remedios took in front of the compadre's tomb was interpreted as
loyalty to her leader, a leader close to which she has 'experienced the
problems of the people' as her loyal 'disciple'" (Alenda Mary, 2002:
118-119). Thus, considering that Palenque led most of the campaign until
the very end, that Remedios was also a charismatic character and that
she displayed clear continuities with her predecessor, I have not
changed the coding from the 1993 elections to the 1997 elections.

## UCS

Solidarity Civic Unity (or UCS) is usually compared to the case of
CONDEPA because both were populist parties that enjoyed relative success
in Bolivia in the 90's and that suffered the loss of their charismatic
founders. Similarly, to Palenque, Max Fernández, founder of UCS, became
famous in his field before he entered politics without previous
experience (1 Insider Populism). Fernández was CEO of the largest beer
company in Bolivia and he was known for his philanthropic donations to
the poor.

Barr (2017: 90) clearly identifies the party as populist due to its use
of "antiestablishment rhetoric and plebiscitarian linkages" and appeals
"to informal sector workers and marginalized groups, including
indigenous populations". The party defended a greater solidarity among
the population (one of its mottos was "The poor less poor and the rich
more solidary" (Alenda Mary, 2002: 97)) and bashed traditional
politicians (Mayorga, 2003: 109). However, the UCS lacked a programmatic
proposal and an ideological profile (Mayorga, 2003: 115). Mayorga (2003)
sums up the party's ideology with the term "asistencialismo".
Asistencialismo implies that the leader solves problems through the
donation of money to a specific marginal group without an ideological
basis and without addressing structural problems. As a wealthy man,
Fernández was able to perform many acts of philanthropy through which he
formed his electoral basis (Mayorga, 2003: 99) which Alenda Mary (2002:
86) has described as "pure clientelism".

Moreover, he cultivated an image of a mestizo self-made man that came
from below and was able to achieve success as a businessman (Mayorga,
2003: 106-107). Barr (2017: 13) considers the UCS as "little more than a
personalistic vehicle" and Alenda Mary (2002: 98) says that their
"program is the leader". As opposed to the large social movement led by
Palenque, Max Fernández's base was created thanks to personalistic ties
with the leader's philanthropic actions (Mayorga, 2003).

Fernández included Aymara candidates in his party (Barr, 2017: 90) and
he also "spoke Quechua on the campaign trail and was often referred to
as a "cholo" entrepreneur, although he generally eschewed identity
politics." (Madrid, 2012: 47). This allowed him to win a "sizable number
of indigenous votes" (Madrid, 2012: 47) (1 in Ethnic Others and
Immigration).

It is difficult to code UCS in the remaining categories. I believe the
less problematic coding is to consider UCS as a Center party, that is
populist in relation to anti-politician rhetoric (3 Political class) but
whose criticisms of foreign powers and economic elite are not as stark
as those of CONDEPA (2 in Foreign Interests and Financial elite). The
party is extremely dependent on its leader (3 in Charisma) who comes
from the business world without any previous political experience (1 in
Insider Populism).

I have not found any indication of a violation of LD norms. As Mayorga
pointed out in relation to both UCS and CONDEPA: "their emergence did
not call into question the democratic regime because they soon
participated in the logic of post-electoral deals that characterized the
access to national and municipal governments" (Mayorga, 2003: 115).

In a similar fashion to CONDEPA, Max Fernández died suddenly in 1995 and
the party had to adapt to the new situation. The leadership role landed
in Jhonny Fernández, Max's son (Alenda Mary, 2002: 111). His legitimacy
derived from him being the son of the party founder and from becoming
mayor of Santa Cruz soon after his father's death (Alenda Mary, 2002:
111-112). He continued with his father's policies and rhetoric and was a
candidate in the 2002 presidential election. However, due to lack of
age, he was not able to run in the 1997 election, and the party chose
Ivo Kulijs, another businessman, to take his place. Barr (2017: 83)
considers the three leaders of UCS as populist, however, Jhonny
Fernández and Ivo Kulijs did not have the charisma of Max Fernández and
they basically attracted voters exploiting the memory of the founder.
Thus, I have coded 1 in Charisma for both Jhonny Fernández and Ivo
Kulijs. During their leadership UCS formed part of Banzer's Right-wing
government support coalition, which speaks to their ideological
flexibility.

## MAS

Movement for Socialism was a dying fascist party when Evo Morales'
political platform used it as a mere legal cover to run for elections in
the 1999 municipal elections (Monasterios et al., 2007: 79). Morales
completely changed the character and ideology of the party in order to
transform it into an indigenous and populist party.

Evo Morales, of Aymara origin, started working in agriculture at an
early age and received little formal education. He later rose as a union
leader of coca plantations in the region of Cochabamba (Madrid, 2012:
63). During the 90's, several of the peasant unions, composed
overwhelmingly of indigenous people, created indigenous parties to run
for election. Although "in the mid-1990s he was still largely unknown
outside of Cochabamba", Evo Morales ran for congress in 1997 as part of
one of these parties winning "seventy percent of the vote, more than any
other congressional candidate in the country" (Madrid, 2012: 63). Due to
conflicts with the leaders of the party, Morales decided to abandon it
and create his own. Since his party could not register on time for the
1999 municipal elections, he allied with MAS as the official running
party. Unexpectedly, Morales surged in the polls in the last weeks of
the 2002 electoral campaign and came in second (Madrid, 2012: 49). He
later won an absolute majority in 2005 and became president. I have
coded him as 1 in Insider Populism in the 2002 and 2005 election and as
3 in the following elections.

What distinguishes MAS from other typical populist movements is the
presence of "strong grassroots bases that help shape the parties'
platforms and policies." (Madrid, 2012: 27). MAS started as an
indigenous party and has always remained committed to that origin. As
Madrid (2012: 53) puts it

> The MAS has succeeded in part because it has appealed to Bolivia's
> indigenous population as indigenous people. It has used a variety of
> methods to woo indigenous voters. First, the MAS has established close
> ties with a vast number of indigenous organizations in the country.
> Second, the MAS has run numerous indigenous candidates, including for
> high-profile positions. Third, the MAS has made a variety of symbolic
> appeals to Bolivia's indigenous population. Fourth and finally, the
> MAS has aggressively promoted traditional indigenous demands. (Madrid,
> 2012: 53).

Furthermore, MAS "called for the recognition of indigenous forms of
medicine and justice and the establishment of programs of intercultural
and bilingual education that would incorporate indigenous traditions and
knowledge" (Madrid, 2012: 56) and was also committed to eliminate racial
discrimination through new labor laws (Movimiento al Socialismo 2002,
25). Lastly, the party's candidates defended not just pro-indigenous
policies but also "often dressed in indigenous clothing, participated in
indigenous rituals, invoked indigenous sayings, and made speeches in
indigenous languages" (Madrid, 2012: 55). 1 in Ethnic others and
Immigration.

However, MAS is not simply an indigenous party, what characterizes
Morales' political platform is the combination of ethnic and populist
elements. Madrid argues that MAS

> runs personalistic electoral campaigns that have revolved around the
> charismatic personality of its presidential candidate \[...\], has
> employed extensive anti-establishment rhetoric, aggressively
> criticizing the traditional parties and politicians \[...\] \[and\]
> has employed nationalist and state interventionist appeals. It has
> staunchly opposed market-oriented policies and U.S. intervention in
> their countries, and it has vowed to assert greater control over their
> countries' natural resources. (Madrid, 2012: 27).

Morales strongly criticized the elite, which he termed "neoliberal
parties," "political mafia," "oligarchy," and "mank'a- gastos"---those
who eat without working (Assies and Salman, 2005: 271). He clearly
articulated the Manichean opposition between people and elite when he
said that "We all know that there are two Bolivias. One Bolivia of
'charlatans' who always make promises and sign agreements that they
never fulfill; and the other Bolivia which is always tricked,
subjugated, humiliated, and exploited" (Morales, cited in Postero, 2004:
190). Morales has described inequality as one of the central reasons for
the formation of the party, declaring that: "We have created our own
political force because wealth and land are being concentrated in the
hands of a few, and the majority of the people live in poverty"
(Zimmerman, 2002: 8).

As Barr argues "he directed his permanent provocation toward a 'second
independence' and the 're-founding of the country.' Morales thus framed
a reformist agenda in very bold terms. For instance, he promised to
'bury neoliberalism,' promote the production of legal coca, nationalize
hydrocarbons, and rewrite the constitution." (Barr, 2017: 106). Morales
also often attacked foreign intervention. In 2002, MAS' governing
program said:

> The neoliberal parties such as the MNR, ADN, MIR, MBL, UCS, NFR,
> CONDEPA and other small groupings of their corrupt circle, are
> characterized by the submission and betrayal of the country, by the
> handing over of the national patrimony almost without charge to the
> voraciousness of international capital and its directors, who impose
> conditions of poverty on the legitimate owners of natural resources.
> (Movimiento al Socialismo, 2002: 9).

Therefore, Morales' rhetoric represents an ideal-typical case of
Left-wing populist rhetoric and I have coded his ideology as Far-Left,
and 3 in Political class, Economic class and Foreign Interests.

It is the combination of the populist and ethnic elements that made the
party adopt an inclusivist strategy and rhetoric. "Beginning in 2002 the
MAS recruited numerous white and mestizo candidates, formed alliances
throughout the country with non-indigenous as well as indigenous
organizations, and developed a more inclusive and populist discourse"
(Madrid, 2012: 28). Central to these alliances was the appointment of
Álvaro García Linera, a well-known leftist academic and a scholar in
populism to become the vice-presidential candidate in 2005 (Harnecker et
al., 2008: 102).

Morales has concentrated the party power around his figure, particularly
in regard to the party's extension to non-indigenous regions. Barr
(2017: 103) explains that Morales's approach "was first to create
urban-based arms of MAS, which were under his personal control. However,
these new urban structures lacked the participatory mechanisms of the
earlier rural ones". "Like other populist leaders, Evo has mostly
declined to build institutional structures that might constrain him or
develop leaders who might challenge him, preferring instead to
concentrate power in his person." (Madrid, 2012: 63). However, Morales'
personalism is not limited to the party's structure but the party in
itself is dependent on his charisma. Some observers speak about 'Evismo'
a phenomenon similar to the personality cults surrounding other populist
leaders like Juan Perón (Benavente 2008, 61). Therefore, although other
indigenous parties would have existed without Morales, a party that
combined populist and ethnic claims in such as successful manner would
have been impossible without the figure of its leader (3 in Charisma).

The army did not constitute a target of Morales' anti-elite rhetoric and
when he took office, he replaced the military leadership with his
supporters as a means to assure himself control of the army (El País,
2007).

In relation to liberal-democratic norms, Mudde and Rovira-Kaltwasser
(2013) point to the political, social and symbolic inclusion of excluded
sectors of Bolivia that Morales has expressed during his campaigns and
achieved during his presidency. However, they also note that

> Although the political initiatives promoted by Chávez and Morales have
> triggered more political participation, they have also undermined the
> rules of public contestation\... \[Morales\] has relied on 'the
> people' as the constituent power in order to undertake constitutional
> reforms that do not necessarily protect the checks and balances that
> are inherent to liberal democracy (Cameron and Sharpe, 2010). (Mudde
> and Rovira-Kaltwasser, 2013: 162)

Morales has concentrated great power in his person, and some have argued
that "Evo is very much of a caudillo \[strongman\], very personalistic.
He does not allow any dissidence. He turns his back on or expels any
legislator who competes with him" (Madrid, 2012: 63). The supreme courts
are chosen in a highly politicized manner and reports on attacks on the
press are abundant (Freedom House, 2018).

Morales has eschewed Bolivian political institutions towards his
policies and aims. Morales called for a constitutional assembly shortly
after winning his first elections. He obtained a majority of seats in
the new assembly and rewrote the Constitution. This was a highly
contentious issue and the political environment became polarized. "In an
effort to break the growing political impasse, in 2008 the government
called for a referendum on whether to recall President Morales and the
departmental governors (prefects). Once again, the MAS triumphed"
(Madrid, 2012: 51). Thus, although he has made significant changes to
prior democratic rules in the country, he has done so with wide popular
support.

In 2016, however, Morales lost a referendum on whether he could be
reelected for a fourth term even though it being prohibited by the
Constitution. Despite the referendums' result and the Constitutional
text, MAS pressured the judges into declaring that article
unconstitutional and have allowed Morales to run for reelection (BBC,
2017). This represents the clearest violation of LD norms committed by
Morales' administration.

Given Morales' initial inclusivist discourse in support of marginalized
groups in Bolivia, I have coded him as 1 in violation of LD norms in the
2002 and 2005 elections. However, once in office, his actions against
democratic check and balances, attacks on the press and violation of the
Constitution point to a coding closer to a 3.
