A military dictatorship was established in Ecuador in 1972, overthrowing
Velasco Ibarra, the great populist figure in the 20^th^Century who had
been president on five different occasions and had declared himself as
dictator two years before. In 1978, the military called for a referendum
and the Ecuadorians chose a new democratic constitution. Presidential
elections were held in 1978-1979 and Jaime Roldós, of the Concentration
of Popular Forces (CFP) was elected president. Ecuadorian politics
include many populist parties. The most relevant ones are CFP, PRE,
Patriotic Society Party and Alianza PAIS.

## CFP

CFP was founded in 1944 by Carlos Guevara Moreno. The party ran on a
populist platform promising to break "the tradition of political
manipulation of the people" (Sosa-Buchholz, 1999: 148). The party
concentrated most of its power in the poor suburbs of Guayaquil and
their leaders "refused to identify themselves with the left, right or
center", emphasizing instead Ecuadorian popular ideology and the
connection with the "*jefe máximo*" or supreme leader (Sosa-Buchholz,
1999: 148).

Jaime Roldós participated in the election as candidate because historic
CFP leader Assad Bucaram, of Lebanese origin, was banned by the military
from participating for not having Ecuadorian parents. The CFP criticized
the military by arguing that the decree was an attack on Bucaram.
Roldós, who was married to Bucaram's niece, "expanded upon the
techniques already developed by CFP leaders" by cultivating an image of
the suburbs (Sosa-Buchholz, 1999: 151). However, soon a conflict arose
between Roldós and Bucaram. In addition, their untimely deaths in 1981,
marked the division and decline of the CFP. The CFP was then led by
Ángel Duarte, a former minister before the military coup who
participated in the 1984 and 1988 presidential elections. Although
Duarte did not have the charisma of his predecessors (1 in Charisma), he
continued with the traditional rhetoric of the CFP and has also been
described as populist (Taufic, 1984). I have coded 2 for insider
populism because although Duarte was once part of the government, it was
before the military coup. He did not have any significant power in the
new democracy.

I have not found any opposition to immigrants, ethnic others or foreign
threats nor did I find any departure from the incipient
Liberal-Democratic norms that the new Ecuadorian democracy was
establishing. It is difficult to establish the ideological position of
the CFP. I have opted for Centre since they combine elements from both
Left and Right, however, N/A would also apply.

## PRE

Abdalá Bucaram, nephew of Assad and brother-in-law of Roldós, led the
division of the CFP and created a new party; the Ecuadorian Roldosist
Party (PRE). He is considered one of the most important populist figures
in Ecuador (Sosa-Buchholz, 1999; De la Torre, 1997; Ulloa, 2017). Abdalá
became the mayor of Guayaquil and then presented his candidacy to the
presidential election in 1988, 1992 and 1996, finally winning the last
year. Abdalá was known as "*el loco*", the crazy one, and presented
himself as a passionate politician who did not abide by the etiquette of
traditional politicians. "He challenges their respectability \[of the
elite\] by glorifying the qualities of the people, insulting his rivals,
and acknowledging and accentuating his own ugliness" and employed
"simple, humorous, direct, and authentically popular language" (De la
Torre, 1997: 17; Moreano and Donoso, 2005). His ideological basis was
summed in one of his campaign slogans: "Only one ideology, against the
oligarchy" (Sosa-Buchholz, 1999: 153). As he stated once: "The oligarchy
is an amorphous entity, an insensitive and exploitative system, an
anti-Christian system. \... I think that the oligarchy is everywhere"
(Bucaram, 1990: 24). De la Torre (1997: 16) argues that the oligarchy is
incarnated mainly in rival politicians thus, for example, "in the 1988
elections, Bucaram presented himself as the child of Christ in struggle
against 'the devil,' \[Socialist leader\] Rodrigo Borja." Bucaram
employed a moralistic language to frame the struggle between the people
and the elite and contrasted the effeminate nature of the elite with the
virility of the Ecuadorian people (De la Torre, 1997: 16).

The ideological classification of Abdalá Bucaram is complicated. Several
authors coincide in the diffuse character of his ideology (Moreano and
Donoso, 2005; Ulloa, 2017). He has been called a neopopulist because "he
campaigned with a leftist discourse but implemented neoliberal measures
during his government and formed his team with members of the oligarchy"
(Ulloa, 2017: 118). He ran on the promise to improve the living
condition of the poor (Sosa-Buchholz, 1999: 153) and had as a campaign
slogan "the strength of the poor" (Ulloa, 2017: 117). In government, he
applied personalistic measures such as the "Abdalact, cheap milk for
Guayaquil's *suburbios*, of free back-packs and textbooks, notebooks and
pencils bearing the president's name for poor students" (Sosa-Buchholz,
1999: 154). However, not only did he never question capitalism (De la
Torre, 1997: 18), he even implemented strong neoliberal policies by
inviting Domingo Cavallo, a former Argentinian finance minister, to
advise him. He also showed a great degree of pragmatism forming
coalitions with other parties or including members of the former
conservative government into his cabinet. I have decided to code him as
Centre-Left to reflect his pro-poor policies, although it should be
noticed that, as other neopopulists in the 90's, he shifted
significantly once in government.

Although the military did not form the main target of his attacks, he
criticized it considerably. In 1985, he flew to Panamá because he was
sentenced to four days in prison for saying that the military "had no
other use than spend money and march in civic celebrations". I have
coded his position as 2. Abdalá tried to "incarnate the representation
of Indians, cholos, whites, blacks and mestizos" (Ulloa, 2017: 120),
thus, I have coded 1 for Immigration and Ethnic Others. On his
leadership role it is important to point out that the party was created
and led by Abdalá. No one disputed his leadership and his style was
extremely personalistic. I have coded 3 in charisma.

Abdalá was related to both Assad Bucaram and Jaime Roldós and was mayor
of Guayaquil, Ecuador's second most important city, before running for
president in 1988. Therefore, he can be considered as a significant
figure in previous governments (2 in Insider Populism). I have not found
references or significant attacks on foreign powers or interests (1 in
OTH_FOREIGN).

Although several authors point to his "lack of respect for the rights of
others" (De la Torre, 1997: 19) or his clientelism (Acosta, 1996), he
did not deviate significantly from the liberal-democratic norms of other
parties (I coded it as 1). In fact, when his economic austere policies
resulted in widespread opposition, he was impeached by the parliament
under the vague pretext of his mental incapacity and was substituted by
an 'interim president' a novel figure for Ecuadorian politics of dubious
constitutionality. A new constitution was approved, and elections
followed in 1998.

With its leader gone and new elections coming soon, the PRE had to find
a replacement and Álvaro Noboa was chosen as the presidential candidate
for the 1998 elections. He was one of the most successful businessmen in
Ecuador. Nevertheless, he lost that election and then founded the
Institutional Renewal Party of National Action, or PRIAN and ran for
president in all elections until 2013, coming in in second place in 2002
and in 2006. Noboa has sometimes been described as a populist (Nohlen et
al. 2005: 372), however, his classification as such is contentious.
Although he cultivates an image of a political outsider, in 1998, he
stressed his technical abilities of management and differentiated
himself from Abdalá Bucaram (Noboa, 1998). More importantly, as Carlos
de la Torre argues, Noboa lacks the manichaean confrontation between the
people and the power in his discourse (Ecuadorinmediato, 2006). He is
better described as a personalistic leader more than as a populist
candidate. Thus, I have not included him in the dataset.

I have, however, included the party it the dataset since the party's
position did not change after Abdalá left office. In the 2002 elections,
the last in which the party obtained more than 5% of the vote, the party
was led by Jacobo Bucaram, Abdalá's older brother. Jacobo was a
sportsman and university chancellor who also became vice-president of
the Congress between 1992 and 1993 and was major of the city of Milagro.
He was known in the country for beating congressman Jamil Mahuad (who
would later become president). He was in favor of the construction of a
united Latin American currency that would help redistribute wealth and
combat the problem of insecurity (BBC Mundo, 2002). He also wished to
renegotiate Ecuador's debt with the IMF and promote an agrarian
revolution (BBC Mundo, 2002). Due to his political career as
vice-president of the congress and mayor I have codified him as a 2 in
Insider Populism and given that he inherited his brother's party, I
coded him as 1 in Charisma.

## Lucio Gutiérrez and the Patriotic Society Party

Gutiérrez was an unknown coronel without political experience (1 in
Insider Populism) who became famous nationwide because of a coup d'état,
in a similar fashion to Chávez. In January 2000, in the midst of a deep
economic crisis, several factions of the military allied with indigenous
movements overthrew the government of Pesident Mahuad. As Gutiérrez
(2002) then declared: "from now on you, the people, will always be put
first and those who have benefited from the people must step aside".
However, the military was not able to hold power and Mahuad's
vice-president was elected president. Gutiérrez was briefly arrested and
later founded the Patriotic Society Party to run for the presidency in
the 2002 elections.

De la Torre argues that Gutiérrez "employed the populist rhetoric of
confrontation between the people, whom he said he represented, against
the oligarchy, symbolized by the corrupt politicians" (De la Torre,
2008: 201). He also exploited the image of the military man as a man of
the people who would not sell himself to "antinational interests" as
well as his humble origins (De la Torre, 2008: 202). I coded 1 in
Military and 2 in Foreign Interests.

The ideological classification of Gutiérrez is not easy because he was
able to "coincile opposed tendencies as well as had an enormous
flexibility to transform itself" (Montúfar, 2008: 269). He could be
described as a neopopulist because of his rhetoric before and after
achieving power. He campaigned on a leftist platform, particularly
concerned with the indigenous movement's claims. Moreover, he campaigned
against neoliberal measures (De la Torre, 2008: 206). He was, however,
less leftist than Chávez, as he himself stated "I admire the courage of
Chávez... for challenging a corrupt government. I did the same in
Ecuador. But I am not a communist. I am deeply Christian and respect
private property and human rights" (El País, 2005). However, once in
power, he soon broke his alliance with leftist and indigenous parties
and supported himself with right-wing parties (Ulloa, 2017: 124). He
then applied measures dictated by the FMI and appointed technocrats with
ties to the business powers (Burbano de lara, 2003). The best
classification I believe that fits Gutiérrez is to code him as Centre
Left in 2002, 3 in Political Class and 2 in Economic Class.

His political platform was strongly based on the indigenous movements,
which he identified as the main component of "the people" (De la Torre,
2008: 218) and he did not attack immigrants. 1 in both Immigration and
Ethnic Others.

The Patriotic Society Party was created by Gutiérrez as a platform to
run for president. The party did not do well in the legislative
elections (2.5% of the vote share), which gives an idea of the lack of
relevance of the party compared to the figure of its leader. The party
later changed its ideological position when Gutiérrez did, which implies
that it did not have a solid ideological basis apart from being
Gutiérrez's platform. I have coded 3 in Charisma, since Gutiérrez's
populism was entirely based on his persona.

Gutiérrez's violation of Liberal-Democratic norms was patently evident.
He became known in his country through a coup d'état against the elected
president. His downfall also showed his lack of respect for LD norms.
Due to corruption scandals, Gutiérrez's alliance with the conservative
parties broke down, and he decided to seek for the help of the PRE and
Álvaro Noboa. He then proceeded to substitute judges in the Supreme
court and those judges declared null the charges against Abdalá Bucaram.
Massive protests followed and Gutiérrez declared the state of exception
and ceased the Supreme Court judges. This was seen as an authoritarian
intervention to the judicial power and, finally, the congress voted to
substitute Gutiérrez with his vice-president, who also had become
extremely critical of Gutiérrez's measures. I have coded 3 in LD Norms.

In the 2006 elections, Gutiérrez was expecting to run for president, but
the Supreme Court removed his political rights for two years. His
brother Gilmar, who also had participated in Gutiérrez's 2000 military
coup and had been a congressman, had to ran instead (1 in Insider
Populism and Charisma). Lucio was, however, able to run on 2009 and 2013
and was the undisputed leader of Patriotic Society Party since he
founded the party (3 in Charisma and Insider Populism). During this
time, his rhetoric was focused on his opposition to Rafael Correa.
Gutiérrez did not lose his populist rhetoric, but the elite was now
embodied by the government of Correa whom he accused of corruption
(Gutiérrez, 2013a). Lucio called into question the transparency of the
elections and criticized Correa for participating in the coup d'état
that overthrew his "democratically elected government, thus violating
the will of the people" (Gutiérrez, 2013a). Gutiérrez was also a critic
of Correa's closure of media outlets and called into question the
impartiality of the Ecuadorian institutions, saying that they only
benefited the president but not the people (Gutiérrez, 2013b).

Gutiérrez continued running a populist platform of difficult ideological
classification. As Bowen (2010: 187) argues, he "generally eschewed
well-defined platforms in favor of personalistic appeals" and
"attempted, with some success, to mobilize clientelist networks that he
had built during his period as president". However, he moved from his
initial leftist positions to become a critic of Correa's progressive
policies. He argued for the lowering of taxes (Gutiérrez, 2012) and had
become, paradoxically, "the preferred candidate among the country\'s
economic elite who see him as the only candidate capable of challenging
Correa" (Bowen, 2010: 189). Thus, although he continued to be a populist
leader, his definition of elite radically changed, and we could argue
that his populism is mainly directed against a political elite (Correa
and his government) and not anymore anti-economic class or anti-foreign
interest. Therefore, I have changed to 1 Economic Elite and Foreign
interest while keeping 3 for Political class and modified his ideology
from left to Centre Right.

## Rafael Correa and PAIS Alliance

Rafael Correa, who obtained his PhD at the University of Illinois, was a
professor of economics in Ecuador when he entered into politics.
Probably because of his technocratic profile, he was called by Alfredo
Palacio to be Minister of Economy after the downfall of Lucio Gutiérrez.
"He was the ultimate outsider---a college economics professor who had
never even belonged to a party" (De la Torre, 2013: 35). He remained
only four months in the post because he disagreed with the free-trade
policies of the government. He then created the movement Alianza PAIS
(Patria Altiva i Soberana) or PAIS Alliance (Proud and Sovereign
Homeland) and won the 2006 elections. Although he was a minister, I have
coded him 1 in Insider Populism because his time as minister was very
brief and previously, he had no political experience or public exposure.

His platform has been repeatedly compared to that of Hugo Chávez (De la
Torre, 2013; Ulloa, 2017). Correa argued for a "citizens revolution"
that called "for the closure of Congress followed by elections for a
constituent assembly that would write a new basic law. The underlying
goal was to break the 'partidocracia' or system of domination by
political parties." (De la Torre, 2013: 36). Since his intention was to
call for a constituent assembly that would create a new constitution and
change the way the political system worked up until then, PAIS Alliance
did not present any candidate for the legislative body. This indicated
his aim to connect directly with the people bypassing the formal
institutions of representation. Ulloa (2017: 127) points out the
importance of Correa's charisma and the concentration of party power in
his hands (3 in Charisma).

His aim was to "refound the homeland" in order to achieve "a radical and
rapid change in the existing structures of Ecuadorean society, in order
to change the bourgeois state into a truly popular one." (Correa, 2012).
In his inaugural speech, he claimed that Ecuador needed to "get its
homeland back" (Correa, 2006a) and argued that, under his government,
"the fatherland was no longer for sale" (Correa, 2006a). "Correa
presented himself as a leftist candidate, anti-international credit
organizations, defendant of sovereignty; he employed an anti-political
discourse that was, above all, anti-party" (Ulloa, 2017: 128). Correa
defined himself as "socialist from a Christian, not Marxist, source; I
like to define myself as a leftist Christian humanist" (Correa, 2006)
whose platform was based primarily on fighting corruption and reversing
neoliberal policies. He claimed that "we will never forget the crimes of
the corrupt bankers who bankrupt us" (Correa, 2006a). Moreover, he
stated that neoliberal policies whose "consequences have been
disastrous" "were not only imposed but were also enthusiastically
applauded by our elites" (Correa, 2006a). Thus, Correa claimed for a
second Independence of Ecuador (De la Torre, 2013: 44) by which "Ecuador
will become independent from international organizations, that represent
foreign paradigms and interests" (Correa, 2006a). The most appropriate
coding for Correa seems to be Far Left in Ideology and 3 in Political
Class, Economical Class and Foreign Interests.

Correa had good relations with the military at the beginning of his
presidency and although it later deteriorated due to spending cuts (ABC,
2016), the military was not a target of his populist speech.

Another of the pillars of Rafael Correa's platform was what in Quechua
is called the "*sumak kawsay*, which literally means 'the life well
lived'" (De la Torre, 2013: 39). The concept "comes from indigenous
cosmology, and aims to build 'the good life,' understood as non-Western
relationships between society, nature, and development." (De la Torre,
2013: 39). This pillar was concretized in Ecuador's new constitution
with the definition of the country as 'plurinational' and the inclusion
of "nature rights". Additionally, Correa included a leader of the
indigenous movement as president of the constituent assembly and
finished his inaugural speech with some words in Quechua (Correa,
2006a). His relations with the indigenous communities deteriorated later
due to disagreements over mineral extraction which the indigenous
communities opposed to, but which Correa's government thought necessary
for the independence of the country (De la Torre, 2013: 41). However,
neither immigration nor other ethnic communities were ever identified by
Correa as part of the elite.

Although Correa claimed to seek the democratization of Ecuador, his
actions in government fall short of his electoral promises (De la Torre,
2013; Ulloa, 2017). Moreover, he launched several attacks on the media
because, as he put it "the media have always been one of the de facto
powers that have dominated Latin American countries." (quoted in De la
Torre, 2013: 42). Members of 'El Universo' were convicted of defamation
for an editorial they wrote, and the newspaper was heavily fined as
well. Moreover, every week Correa hosted 'Enlace Ciudadano' a three-hour
show in which he criticized the media's representation of his government
treating them as political actors (Ulloa, 2017: 289). Insults and
mocking of other political leaders were very common in his shows.

Furthermore, his call for a constituent assembly has been questioned for
its legality (Ulloa, 2017: 136,137). That possibility was not one of the
prerogatives of the president in the constitution and it completely
bypassed the legislative body. However, he went ahead with his plans due
to his massive popular support. De la Torre (2013: 33) argues that
Correa represents a case of "soft authoritarianism" similar to that of
Chávez. Taking into consideration his attacks on the press, I have coded
him as 3 in Lib-Dem Norms.

Carlos de la Torre (2017: 39) points out that Correa, himself an
'expert' in economics as an academic, exhibited a kind of technocratic
populism by which he had the knowledge to rebuild his nation and bring
progress and modernization. Thus, he combined technocracy with populism.
Lenín Moreno, vice-president during most of Correa's years in power and
UN special delegate on disability issues would represent this
technocratic element in his government. Moreno won the 2017 elections
with Alliance PIAS. Moreno has a leftist ideology and continues with
many of Correa's policies; however, he is less charismatic than his
predecessor and does not employ the level of confrontational rhetoric
that Correa did. Although many saw him as the marionette of Correa, he
soon started to differentiate himself from Correa in what De la Torre
(2018) calls Ecuador's 'perestroika'. Moreno has strongly persecuted
corruption, removed the asylum to Julian Assange and engaged in a
dialogue with all political forces, including Right-wing parties, moves
that have been strongly criticized by Correa. Moreno's case can be
compared to that of Juan Manuel Santos in Colombia and his relationship
with Álvaro Uribe, where a non or less populist leader inherited the
party that the populist leader created. Following the criteria used with
Santos and acknowledging that Moreno has inherited mainly Correa's
ideological basis but not so much his populism, I have not included him
in the dataset. I have, however. Included Alliance PAIS in the
legislative elections as a way to show that the party is still very much
influenced by Correa's personality (I changed Charisma from 3 to 1 to
indicate the difference in importance of the leader). Whether Moreno
will be able to change the character of the party in the future or not
is an open question.

## MPD

The Popular Democratic Movement is not included in the dataset because
it has been described as a "traditional party" based on a communist and
Maoist ideology (De la Torre, 2013: 34-35) with strong connections with
the country's unions. Although it briefly supported Lucio Gutiérrez and
Rafael Correa, it later became part of the opposition to these populist
leaders. None of the sources consulted describes this party as populist.
