<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fmln">FMLN</h2>
<p>El Salvador suffered a Civil War from 1980 until 1992. The war started when El Salvador was controlled by a military-led Junta and confronted the Government against the FMLN. During the Civil War, the FMLN was an umbrella organization that coordinated, at least, 5 left-wing guerrilla groups. El Salvador approved a new constitution in 1983, held its first truly democratic elections in 1984 and reached a peace agreement with the FMLN in 1992. The Chapultepec Peace Accords included the demobilization of armed forces and the legalization of the FMLN as a political party. Since the 1994 presidential elections, the FMLN has become the main left-wing party of the country.</p>
<p>The inclusion of a Marxist guerrilla in a classification of populist parties is bound to be contested by those who see populist and communist political discourses as categorically different. However, there are many elements in common. The FMLN makes a clear distinction between the masses and the elite in the form of an oppressive state and, after 12 years of Civil War, considers the “other” as enemies rather than as political adversaries. Nonetheless, the FMLN accepted the democratic route to gain power (Zamora, 1998: 227). Sprenkels (2018) argues that the party went through an “ambivalent moderation” in which the party was recurrently in internal conflict between the different factions within it. It should be noted that the FMLN is far from an ideologically unified party and it has had numerous internal struggles.</p>
<p>Allison and Martin (2012) explain that the party has been torn apart by two main tendencies: one the one side the “orthodox” or “revolutionary socialists”, which saw peace as the next step towards achieving the revolution and were more ideologically radical and on the other side the “moderates” or “renovators” which argued that the peace was the revolution and which moderated their discourse. In the internal clashes between these broad tendencies, the hard-liners managed to hold control of the organization most of the time and this led to up to three splits from the moderate faction and the creation of new parties. However, since all of these new parties failed to achieve significant electoral support and the FMLN increased its share of votes election after election, the main position of the FMLN lied with the “orthodox”. After the first split in 1994 election, for example, the remining organizations in the FMLN “reaffirmed their identities as Marxist revolutionary organizations and their intent on constructing socialism” (Allison and Martin, 2012: 99). Moreover, the FMLN document outlining its principles displays a commitment to “serve the interests of the majority” and a strong patriotism (FMLN, 2011). Therefore, I labelled 3 in Political class and Financial Elite and FL as the ideology of the party.</p>
<p>Sprenkels (2018: 15) states that “in government, the FMLN has done little to enhance institutional checks and balances”. It even tried to undermine the country’s Supreme Court’s independence (Réserve, 2016: 192). Additionally, Mauricio Funes fled the country because he was being investigated for corruption. Moreover, the victory of the orthodox faction in the 2000s led to a reinstating of the Leninist understanding of the party and to the suppression of the internal democratic elections to choose candidates (Acevedo Moreno, 2006). Furthermore, clientelism was a practice well extended within the party (Sprenkels, 2018: 15). I believe these elements deserve a 3 in violation of LD norms.</p>
<p>On Foreign Policy Interests, the party held a “vocal opposition to the country’s dollarization and participation in any free trade agreement with the US” (Sprenkels, 2018: 13) and displayed a continuous anti-imperialistic sentiment (Sprenkels, 2018: 17). However, Mauricio Funes has taken a different direction and has strengthened commercial and political relations with the US despite disagreement from the FMLN leadership (Allison and Martín, 2012: 112). I have coded 3 for Foreign Policy since 1994 with the exception of the period of Mauricio Funes where I have coded 2 in order to show this more moderate -but not fully welcoming- position regarding the US.</p>
<p>After 12 years of Civil War, the demilitarization of the country was seen as essential to achieve peace and it was one of the main objectives of the FMLN (Zamora, 2017). According to the FMLN, the military participated and perpetuated crimes during the war and formed part of the state’s repression. However, the main enemies were the paramilitary death squadrons and the demilitarization was effectuated according to the Peace Accord. Therefore, I have coded 2 for military because it is possible to distinguish between the military and the political elite and the former received most of the criticism.</p>
<p>None of the presidential candidates belonged to the inner circle of decision making of the previous government with the exception of Salvador Sánchez Cerén, who was Funes’ vice-president and Hugo Martínez, who was Sánchez Cerén’s Minister of Foreign Affairs. The FMLN is based on an endogenous ideology and is not based on the personality of any leader. In fact, according to Allison and Martín (2012) the FMLN owed part of its defeats to the selection of unpopular presidential candidates within the pool of former guerrilla leaders. Mauricio Funes represented a departure in this tendency and run on a platform supported not only by the FMLN but by an organization called “Friends of Funes” completely based on his personal figure. Therefore, I have coded all elections 1 in Inner Populism until 2012 and 3 in the remaining elections. I labelled all elections 1 for Personality Dependent except for 2009. Immigration and ethnic others are not depicted as enemies or threats for the FMLN.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="nayib-bukele">Nayib Bukele</h2>
<p>Nayib Bukele became president of El Salvador in 2019. He is a former businessman from Palestinian origins that belonged to the FMLN. With this party, he became the mayor of the capital, but he did not take part in the national government of the FMLN (1 in Insider Populism). He created a new party in 2017 and was expelled from the FMLN. The new party, however, was forbidden by the courts to run in the 2019 elections because the inscription period had already pass. Bukele decided, then, to be the presidential candidate of GANA, a right-wing party. It is still unsure how much influence will this party have in his government but Bukele argues that it used that party only as a necessary means to an end (ABC, 2019) and openly disagrees with some of its ideas. It is difficult to pin down Bukele’s ideology. Some argue that he is a “classic populist” for which the categories of left and right are not useful any more (BBC, 2019). However, given its emphasis in the country’s poor in his discourses, his previous membership of the FMLN and his self-definition as progressive, I have coded Left as his ideology. Moreover, the fact that Nayib Bukele presented itself as the candidate of a party with a different ideology, based the campaign solely in his figure and still won the election in the first round, shows the extreme importance of the personality of the presidential candidate. I labelled 3 in Personality Dependent.</p>
<p>The main axis of Bukele’s campaign consists in presenting himself as an outsider that will fight the corruption of the two ruling parties (ABC, 2019). He argues that the inefficient and corrupt management of the previous governments is responsible for El Salvador’s deplorable economic and social situation. He defended that “this battle is for every person from El Salvador that has been ignored by their governments” (Bukele, 2019a) and used short mottos such as “they should return what they stole” or “there is enough money when nobody steals it” to depict the previous governments as corrupt. Thus, I have coded 3 for “Political Class”.</p>
<p>As a businessman himself, Bukele aims at creating a productive economy for El Salvador that will improve the conditions of the country. He did not display animosity against the financial elite but defined the elite in primarily political terms. Therefore, I believe 1 in Financial Elite accurately reflects his position.</p>
<p>On Foreign Interests, Bukele has repeated constantly his desire to “re-establish, improve and increase relations with the US” (Bukele, 2019b). Bukele has not displayed any antagonism against any other country but has harshly criticized Maduro’s (Venezuela) and Ortega’s (Nicaragua) governments for using force to remain in power (BBC, 2019), which contrasts with the position taken by Sánchez Cerén. Being himself of migrant origins Bukele made no negative mention of incoming migrants or ethnic groups. Lastly, Bukele has not taken any action against LD norms.</p>
