<section id="apra" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="apra">APRA</h2>
<p>The APRA has been Peru’s main leftist part party for most of the 20th Century. It was founded and headed by Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre, who was considered as the prototype of populist leader in Perú (Stein, 1999: 101) and who presided the constitutional assembly of Perú after the military government of General Velasco Alvarado. The first democratic elections were held in 1980 and Armando Villanueva was the candidate for APRA. In his campaign spots there are references to the mobilization of the people such as “Armando will come, the people will triumph” (Villanueva, 1980a) or “we will take care of the poor people above all” (Villanueva, 1980b). Nevertheless, there is no explicit criticism of the elites and his campaign should be understood as aligned with that of a leftist ideology. I have not found any references in the literature that treat him a populist and in 1985, he supported Javier Valle in the primaries against Alan García when the former accused the later of risking the “leftist position” of the party with his “Caesarist style” (Ortiz de Zárate, 2016). This episode points to the fact that Villanueva was more a traditional left-wing politician than a populist and thus, I have not included him in the dataset.</p>
</section>
<section id="alan-garcía" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="alan-garcía">Alan García</h2>
<p>Alan García won the presidency in 1985 as the candidate of APRA. García had never held office positions before (1 in Insider Populism). He employed several populist methods such as the “balconazos” (spontaneous public appearances in the balcony government to make announcements and speak with the people (Stein, 1999: 111)). He also appeared unannounced at different places in the country to discuss and talk with the citizens. García defended his platform as nationalist and claimed that his aim was to “give the people back their government” (García, 1984) so that it would “not be the loot of a few who share the membership of the party of the government” (García, 1985). García based his campaign in criticizing the neoliberal economic model of President Belahúnde, on critiquing corruption in the public administration and in fighting the violence of the guerrilla group “Sendero Luminoso” (Ortiz de Zárate, 2016). Moreover, he aimed at creating a broad class interest, including the “business class” in the efforts to make the economy grow (Crabtree, 1996: 576; Ortiz de Zárate, 2016). I have coded 3 for Political Class but 2 for Financial Class.</p>
<p>Alan García developed a “personality cult” (Crabtree, 1996: 576) around his figure. The APRA was established as a party long before García, but his personality greatly shaped it in 1985 (2 for Personality Dependent) and explains in part its success (El País, 1986).</p>
<p>The leader of APRA defended economic nationalism against international banking and the institutions directed by Washington (Crabtree, 1996: 575) and said that “IMF’s hateful and damaging mediation only benefits those who wish to see more inequality” (Ortiz de Zárate, 2016). In the presidency, he later declared a restructuring of the debt and nationalized several industries. Therefore, I have coded 3 for Foreign Interests.</p>
<p>Alan García was investigated by corruption during his government as well as promoting, or at least, allowing for repressive counter-terrorist measures to take place by the paramilitary group “Comando Rodrigo Franco” (Ortiz de Zárate, 2016). I labelled 3 for Violation of LD norms.</p>
<p>On the relationship with the army, Alan García declared a state of emergency in several areas in order to fight “Sendero Luminoso”, which gave the army considerable power for long periods of time (El País, 1986). I found no reference in which he considers the military to be part of the elite.</p>
<p>García’s government ended in very poor economic conditions, with inflation reaching very high levels and the conflict with “Sendero Luminoso” raging. His popularity plummeted and Luis Alva Castro was chosen as the candidate to run in the 1990 election for APRA. After the 1990 election, Alan García was persecuted by Fujimori and had to flee the country. He later moderated his discourse and neither in the 2001 nor in 2006 (when he won for the second time) should he be considered a populist. Luis Alva Castro, the APRA’s candidate in 1990 did not had the populist discourse that Alan García had employed in his 1985 election (Crabtree, 1992: 164). As second Vice-president and Ministry of Economy, Alva Castro was seen as part of the establishment and could not shake-off the blame for the terrible economic situation of the country (Crabtree, 1992: 160). I have not included him in the dataset.</p>
</section>
<section id="alberto-fujimori" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="alberto-fujimori">Alberto Fujimori</h2>
<p>Alberto Fujimori was a mathematics professor and university rector from Japanese descent who had never held elected office or had been part of a political party before 1990 (Levitsky and Loxton, 2012: 164). He was completely unknown to the public and neither him nor his newly created party, “Cambio 90”, were polling strongly until shortly before the election (1 in Insider Populism). He was able to beat his opponent, the writer Mario Vargas Llosa, due to its condition as an outsider and anti-politician figure (Stein, 1999: 115). The country suffered at the time a very severe economic crisis for which traditional parties were blamed (Levitsky and Loxton, 2012: 165). Moreover, the conflict with “Sendero Luminoso” was also at its peak and confidence in politicians was extremely low (Levitsky and Loxton, 2012: 165). Although the party would have not existed without Fujimori, his success is explained more by the economic and social circumstances of the moment than by Fujimori’s popularity. I believe this deserves a 2 in Personality Dependent.</p>
<p>Fujimori ran a campaign based on the criticism of the establishment and looked for a direct connection with the people. He adopted the slogan “A President like you” (Levitsky and Loxton, 2012: 167) and defined the election as a “confrontation between the white elite … and the non-white common people” (de la Torre, 2000: 124). He mobilized sectors of the population that were at the margins of politics, particularly evangelicals and the informal sector (Levitsky and Loxton, 2012: 166). On economic issues, Fujimori vehemently opposed the neoliberal shock doctrines that he attributed to Vargas Llosa. In the presidential debate, Fujimori told Vargas Llosa that state’s intervention had created “a complex system of incentives which are not in favor of the poorest but that respond to the power groups that, unfortunately Dr Vargas, lie behind you” (Fujimori, 1990). Fujimori should be labelled 3 in Political Class and in Financial Elite.</p>
<p>Fujimori belongs to a small ethnic minority in Peru, a fact that he employed to depict himself as someone of the margins, someone who represented the Peru of the “the cholos”, that is, the darker-skinned poor majority that was looked down upon by the white elite (Panfichi, 1997). He actively embraced the nickname “el chino” and the C90 lists included several candidates that “spoke Quechua and worked in the informal economy” (Daeschner, 1993: 261). On Foreign Interests, Fujimori travelled to the US before his inauguration and struggled to maintain good relations with foreign powers during his presidency (McClintock, 2002).</p>
<p>Similar to the case of Menem in Argentina, shortly after winning, Fujimori took a turn to the right and embraced neoliberal reforms. Levitsky and Loxton (2012: 169) and Weyland (1999: 184) explain that he forged a tacit alliance with the power groups of Peruvian society, including the military, the internationally competitive industry and the financial sector. This, however, did not make him less populist. He simply “lost the class-based elements of his anti-elite discourse and stepped up his attacks on the political elite” (Levitsky and Loxton, 2012: 170). For the 1995 elections, I have changed from 3 to 1 the category of Financial elite and I have coded Ideology as “right-wing” instead of “left-wing”.</p>
<p>Since he was still constrained by a legislative chamber dominated by traditional parties, he argued that Peru was not a real democracy. In 1992, backed by the military, he carried out the “autogolpe”, a presidential coup which allowed him to close the congress, dissolve the constitution and purge the judiciary (Levitsky and Loxton, 2012: 171). The “autogolpe” was widely supported by Peruvians and it was followed by elections for a constituent assembly, a referendum on the new constitution and again presidential elections in 1995, which Fujimori won by a landslide. Newspapers and television networks received large amounts of money by the government to assure their support (Levitsky and Loxton, 2012: 176) and he declared a law of amnesty for the military. Fujimori’s own constitution banned him from running for a third re-election, but he refused to obey the constitutional tribunal, made the congress impeach the judges and ran in 2000 under the platform “Perú 2000” (Conahgan, 2005: 126-300). His opponent, Álvaro Toledo, boycotted the election for considering it corrupt and Fujimori was elected again. Soon after, however, a video showing a close associate of Fujimori bribing politicians triggered the downfall of the regime. Fujimori flew the country and new elections were called in 2001. All the actions of Fujimori clearly deserve a 3 in violation of LD norms.</p>
</section>
<section id="fujimorismo" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fujimorismo">“Fujimorismo”</h2>
<p>“Fujimorismo” survived after the downfall of its founder. New Majority and C90 created a coalition named “Alliance for the Future” and tried to present Alberto Fujimori as their candidate for the 2006 presidential election. However, since Fujimori was disqualified by the congress to run for office, Martha Chávez, former President of the Congress in the 1990s, was elected as the running candidate (1 for Personality Dependent and 3 for Insider Populism). Her platform continued the politics of “Fujimorismo”.</p>
<p>In 2011, “Fujimorismo” presented Keiko Fujimori, Alberto’s daughter, as the presidential candidate of “Force 2011”. Keiko had become first lady of Peru after her parent’s got divorced in 1994 and belong to the inner circle of his father’s government. Keiko made it to the second round in both the 2011 and 2016 elections but lost both of them. Her right-wing populist campaign is based in means-targeted policies for the poor, a tough stance on crime and an opposition to LGBT rights (El Mundo, 2016). Keiko continues employing an anti-elitist discourse. After losing the 2016 election, for example, she said that “in the second round, our opposition included the political power of this outgoing government, the economic powers and the powers of the media,” (Dow Jones Institutional News, 2016). Moreover, she argued that her party would “defend the interest of the people against lobbies and the power of big business” (Dow Jones Institutional News, 2016). I have coded her in a similar fashion as Alberto Fujimori’s 1995 and 2000 campaigns.</p>
</section>
<section id="ollanta-humala" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ollanta-humala">Ollanta Humala</h2>
<p>Ollanta Humala was an army commander, son of Isaac Humala, founder of the ideology of “etnocaceriso”, a nationalist ideology in Peru reminiscent of the Inca empire which claims the superiority of the “raza cobriza” (darker-skinned race) over others and defends the creation of an authoritarian regime. Together with his brother, Ollanta carried out a failed coup d’état against the government of Fujimori in 2000 which made them win popularity. They were later pardoned by the Congress and Ollanta founded the Peruvian Nationalist Party in 2005. However, he did not register it on time for the elections and decided to run as the candidate of another party; Union for Peru. He had never held an governmental position or participated in party politics before (I for Insider Populism).</p>
<p>For the 2006 election, Humala moderated somewhat his discourse, he declared himself as nationalist but not “etnocacerista” and embraced democracy (Nesbet-Montecinos, 2011: 85). Ollanta’s campaign was considered to be “left nationalist”, was supported by Chávez and Evo Morales and strongly opposed neoliberalism (Nesbet-Montecinos, 2011: 86). Humala made extensive use of the colors of the Peruvian flag in his campaign and used as motto the phrase “love for Peru” (Cabanillas, 2016: 183). He blamed the “traditional politicians” for the misery of Peru (Revesz, 2006: 91) and in the presidential debate against Alan García, Humala (2006) tried to depict his opponent as corrupt and as representative of an outdated elite (3 for Political Class). Ollanta rejected the United States–Peru Trade Promotion Agreement and defended the nationalization of the energy industries (Nesbet-Montecinos, 2011: 86).</p>
<p>Ollanta moderated considerably his anti-capitalist stance in the 2011 election (Cabanillas, 2016: 183). He stilled enjoyed the support of Chávez and Morales and criticized harshly the corruption of the politicians before him. Thus, I have lowered from 3 to 2 Financial Elite and Foreign Interests in 2011.</p>
<p>Humala was accused of violation of human rights in 1991 (Revesz, 2006: 91) and linked to the assault to a police station perpetrated by his brother in 2004. In 2011, he signed a “Declaration in favor of Democracy and Against the Dictatorship” in which he defended the independence of the judiciary, the respect for human rights and the rejection of corruption, which granted him the support of Vargas Llosa and other intellectuals that wished to prevent a victory of Keiki Fujimori. However, Humala is currently investigated for corruption during his time in office. I have labelled these mixed evidence as 2 in Violation of LD norms.</p>
<p>Ollanta’s platform emphasized the need to reinvigorate the countryside of Peru, particularly of its indigenous people (1 in Immigration and Ethnic Others). On the military, Humala criticized the use of the military under Fujimori’s regime but, being himself a commander, he supported greatly the army during his years as President by investing heavily in them (Humala, 2015).</p>
<p>Humala’s campaign was based entirely on his figure; in 2006 he ran as a candidate of another party and managed to reach to the second round unexpectedly. The posters in the 2011 election emphasized the personal figure of Ollanta in a campaign in which he moderated somewhat his views. The movement would not have existed without him and that is why I have labelled 3 in Personality Dependent.</p>
</section>
<section id="veronika-mendoza" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="veronika-mendoza">Veronika Mendoza</h2>
<p>Verónika Mendoza represented the left-wing populist option in the 2016 election. She had been an MP of the Peruvian Nationalist Party but left the party in 2012 and joined the Broad Front (“Frente Amplio”). In the Presidential debate she clearly employed a populist discourse when saying that “we face an election, or we continue to have governments that are at the service of the very few or we have a government that is at the service of the people” (Mendoza, 2016). She also stated that “we will be a government of the people” and that “in a government of the Broad Front, the priority will be you” (Mendoza, 2016). Mendoza received the support of Pablo Iglesias, leader of Spain’s “Podemos”, and has linked ecology with an anti-elitist message: “government after government have consumed our resources without thinking about the people” (Mendoza, 2015). The axes of her platform were “an economy that excludes nobody, a state without corruption, rights without discrimination and progress without contamination” (Mendoza, 2015). I have coded 3 for Political Class and Financial Elite.</p>
<p>Mendoza speaks Quechua and her manifesto proposed to make Peru a “plurinational” state and respect the right to autonomy of indigenous people (Frente Amplio, 2016). I have not been able to find any negative references to the military nor any intended violation of LD norms. Mendoza’s manifesto reinstates the importance of national sovereignty and the ownership of natural resources but does not identify any explicit foreign threat to Peru (Frente Amplio, 2016). Given her ideological position, I have coded 2 for Foreign Interest.</p>
