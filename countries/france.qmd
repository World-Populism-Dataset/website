# Case notes

## Front National

The Front National (FN) began in the 1970s as a conglomeration of
several right-wing groups. It has gone through several ideological
phases, focussing initially on anti-communism (1970s), then opposition
to immigration (1980s-) and more recently opposition to globalisation
(1990s-) (Hainsworth and Mitchell 2000, 444), and until 2011 was led by
Jean-Marie Le Pen. The FN grew steadily through successive legislative
and presidential elections, leading up to Le Pen's break out performance
in the 2002 presidential elections, the first in which he made it to the
second round (and lost with 17.8%). Le Pen was succeeded by his daughter
Marine in 2011, who recorded another second-round presidential
appearance in 2017, also losing but with an increased 33.9%.

In its criticism of elites and championing of "ordinary folk" (Balent
2013, 177), the party has always had an anti-elite and
anti-establishment motif (Van Kessel 2015, 45; Hainsworth 2004, 107;
Rydgren 2008, 166), and it denigrated opponents with "highly hostile"
rhetoric (Eatwell 2002, 14). According to Rydgren, this involved a
strategy of depicting "all political parties as constituting a single,
homogeneous political class" (Rydgren 2008, 174). Le Pen claimed in 1995
for example that the "rotation \[of mainstream left and right parties in
the fifth republic\] is false, since there are no differences between
the two components of French politics" (cited in Rydgren 2008, 177). The
party's core accusation against this political class has been both
corruption (Hainsworth 2004, 104), and national betrayal (Shields 1995,
24). This anti-establishment attitude was maintained by Marine Le Pen,
whose campaigns considered established parties "crooked" (Stockemer and
Barisione 2017, 104). We've therefore coded FN 3 for OTH_POLCLASS.

However the central ideological principle of the party has always been
its OTH_IMMIGRANT and OTH_ETHNIC focus (Marcus 1995; Hainsworth and
Mitchell 2000, 444; Rydgren 2008, 168). Its "national preference" policy
explicitly advocated supporting French nationals over people from other
backgrounds (even those with legal residency) in state programmes
(Hainsworth 2004, 106; Hainsworth and Mitchell 2000, 106). This
reflected that party's ethno-nationalist ideas about the French nation
being under siege from Third World migrant cultures and transnational
affinities and structures like globalisation, the European Union and
Islam (Balent 2013, 165; Hainsworth and Mitchell 2000, 445; Eatwell
2002, 12). On both variables, while there is a difference between the
radical proposals of the 1980s and the somewhat more moderate approaches
of recent years (Hainsworth 2004, 106), this should not see the party
decline from a 3.

More complicated are the OTH_ECONOMIC and OTH_FOREIGN variables. In
economic policy, the party originally claimed a neoliberal identity in
the 1970s and 1980s, advocating privatisations, lower taxes and
free-marketism (Bastow 1997, 64). While it did possess a general
suspicion of big business common on the far right (Bastow 1997;
Hainsworth and Mitchell 2000, 446), we've not seen evidence that
financial elites themselves were an "other" or an "enemy" to the party's
conception of ordinary people. The FN's economic policy began to veer
toward protectionism in the 1990s, which was bound with its opposition
to globalisation, and came in the form of opposing free trade and
"multinationals" (Bastow 1997, 65). According to Rydgren, (Rydgren 2008,
170), multinational corporations became a target of the party's populist
rhetoric. The work of Ivaldi (Ivaldi 2015, 358--60) in particular shows
how more leftward economic policy has become increasingly important to
the FN search for working class voters, particularly in the post-GFC
period, as (under Marine) the party portrayed the elite in economic
terms. It does not appear that this has ever reached a 3 on the
OTH_ECONOMIC scale, as the party has still prioritised the cultural and
ethnic dimensions of populism (Balent 2013, 163). We've increased this
from 1 to 2 in 2012, further research should confirm the timing and
degree of this.

While the party's direct focus on globalisation dates to the 1990s, its
OTH_FOREIGN populism has always been strong, initially with the elder Le
Pen's hostility to the United States, NATO, and the WTO (Hainsworth
2004, 107). In 2001, for example, Jean-Marie claimed that France was
becoming an "American protectorate" (Hainsworth 2004, 107). Like many
far-right parties in Europe, the EU has grown as a target of FN's
populism, and today constitutes a clear enemy of the French nation
(Rydgren 2008, 170). This consistent opposition to various foreign
influences warrants a 3 on the OTH_FOREIGN scale. We've seen no evidence
for anything on the OTH_MILITARY variable (= 1).

The FN has always been strongly identified with the Le Pens (Balent
2013, 170; Stockemer 2019, 342), and although it has included anti-Le
Pen factions over the years it has been highly centralised in its
structure (Shields 1995, 23). Under Jean-Marie Le Pen it has been
routinely called a "charismatic" party (Ivaldi and Lanzone 2016, 132),
and despite Marine Le Pen's less performative leadership style (Balent
2013, 162), it has maintained a similar "personality cult" around her
(Stockemer 2019). We've therefore coded it 3 n CHARISMA.

This difference in leadership also relates to the party's LIBDEMNORMS
classification. We don't see evidence that the party has ever been a 3
on this scale, and it appears to have stressed its support for democracy
at various points in its life (Rydgren 2008, 176) in order to rebuff the
accusation that it is a neo-fascist party, even while flirting with some
authoritarian anti-system rhetoric. According to Balent (Balent 2013,
186), Marine has decisively sought to change course on this and develop
an image for the Front that, while anti-establishment in the populist
sense, is a part of the democratic political system. For this reason we
have labelled the party 2 under Jean-Marie and 1 under Marine. Neither
leader has ever been a member of a government (INSIDER = 1).

## France Unbowed 

*La France Insoumise* (LFI), which is variously translated as "France
Unbowed", "Rebellious France", and "Unsubmissive France", is the leftist
party founded by Jean-Luc Mélenchon. Mélenchon, a former Socialist Party
Minister between 2000 and 2002, left the party in 2008 over policy
direction, initially founding The Left Party (*Parti de gauch*, PDG) and
heading The Left Front (*Front de gauche*) coalition for the 2012
elections where he tallied a surprising 11%. While the PDG faded after
that vote, Mélenchon's profile received a major boost by the 2016
protests against labour reforms by the Socialist government (Damiani
2017, 2), after which he founded LFI to face the 2017 presidential and
parliamentary elections on an anti-austerity and anti-neoliberalism
agenda.

Mélenchon campaigned on a clearly anti-establishment discourse, vowing a
programme of "degagisme" (clearing out) of the political "caste" (Ivaldi
2019, 4; Behrent 2017, 76) and a "citizen insurrection" via the ballot
(Marlière 2019, 97). According to Ducange (Ducange 2015, 65) the
"people" vs "elite" discourse was more important to Mélenchon than
"left" vs "right". He therefore avoided identifying as a leftist on the
campaign trail (Marlière 2019, 96). This included parties on the left
and right of the established party system (Clift and McDaniel 2017). The
other (linked) enemy to Mélenchon's idea of the ordinary people was the
"oligarchy", which he pledged to "sweep away" (Ivaldi 2019, 4)
(OTH_ECONOMIC = 3). According to several scholars (Damiani 2017, 2;
Marlière 2019, 100; Hamburger 2018, 103) Mélenchon and LFI are inspired
directly by the Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe theory that broad and
heterogenous opposition to neoliberalism should create new groups of
citizens that transcend traditional categories like "workers" or
organisations like unions -- hence the party's embrace of more populist
social categories than the traditional left.

There is some debate about whether Mélenchon should be considered a
populist in both the 2012 and 2017 elections. According to a number of
sources, while he campaigned as a conventional left wing candidate in
2012, his second campaign shed many symbols and language of the left
(class and social divisions, red flags and socialist anthems) and
replaced them with patriotic symbols of a more general "people" (the
national flag and anthem) which had traditionally been associated with
the right (Marliére 2017; Hamburger 2018, 106--7). However some who
document this very shift still identify classically people/elite
discourse in his earlier run (Marlière 2019), and most voices in the
literature categorise FDG as populist in 2012 (Ivaldi 2019; Ducange
2015, 65). Based on the presence of anti-elitism, we've included
Mélenchon's 2012 campaign in the dataset and classified him as 2 on
OTH_POLCLASS in 2012 and 3 in 2017.

LFI is hostile to the European Union on economic grounds. It has accused
the EU of imposing a "tyranny" on France via liberal economic orthodoxy
and free trade (Ivaldi 2019, 6), and called the Eurozone pressure for
austerity "German Poison" (Ducange 2015, 70). Mélenchon has in fact
routinely linked problems in Europe to the "German Imperium", or
Germany's plan to reinstate its dominance over the continent (Bonansinga
2022, 518). While Mélenchon claimed in 2017 that his "plan A" was to
radically reform the EU's treaties, his "plan B" in the event of a
failure was to leave the EU (Drake 2018, 98), and the *Insoumise* title
of the party could be considered to refer (at least in part) to a
reclaiming of sovereignty in the face of foreign pressure (OTH_FOREIGN =
3).

As opposed to the nativist FN, LFI is considered "socially inclusive"
and did not campaign against immigration (Ivaldi 2019) (OTH_ETHNIC = 1,
OTH_IMMIGRANTS = 1) It is universally considered a party of the "radical
left" French tradition (despite Mélenchon's eschewing of the term), and
we have coded it FL on LRPOSITION. Its campaigns have been based around
Mélenchon's personal charisma (Lorimer 2017, 2; Ivaldi 2019, 10;
Marlière 2019, 95), and he is usually considered a "strong personality"
(Ducange 2015, 65) or even the leader of a "cult of personality" (Clift
and McDaniel 2017, 411) that anchors the party's image (CHARISMA = 3).
As a "seasoned career politician" (Marlière 2019, 96) and a former
cabinet minister, we've coded LFI 2 on INSIDER. The party is somewhat
difficult to code on LIBDEMNORMS. It has been generally hostility to
media scrutiny and representative democratic institutions (Hamburger
2018, 100), but we've not seen quite enough evidence that this warrants
coding above 1.
