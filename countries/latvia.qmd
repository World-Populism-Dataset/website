title: Latvia
---


Latvia is generally considered a country where populist rhetoric
(particularly in the form of anti-corruption politics) is everywhere,
including in the main parties, making it a very difficult case. Several
authors have suggested that the master cleavages of Latvian politics
have been ethno-linguistic (Latvian speakers and Russian speakers) and,
within the ethnic Latvian side of that cleavage, corruption
(anti-corruption vs "oligargic" parties) (Auers, 2013:86). Most populist
parties have been short-lived entrants within the anti-corruption side
of the Latvian bloc, although the far-right National Alliance has
recently emerged on Latvian ethno-centric lines.

Latvia's politics has also been generally been very volatile, with a
succession of new parties winning big in post-communist elections. There
are quite a few difficult calls below, and some parties that arguably
could be featured that are currently not.

## People\'s Movement for Latvia (Seigerists' Party)

People\'s Movement for Latvia (*Tautas Kustība Latvijai*, TKL) was
founded in 1994 to contest in the 1995 election. As its semi-formal
nickname **--** Seigerists' Party **--** suggests, it was the vehicle of
its founder, controversial German-Latvian businessman and former LNNK MP
Joaachim Siegerists, "a demagogic populist with a talent for
self-advertisement" (Davies & Ozolins, 1996:126). Siegerists, born in
Germany, only discovered his Latvian heritage in 1992, at which point he
decided to become engaged in the Latvian political scene without even
speaking the Latvian language fluently (Nissinen, 1999:137). Despite
this, TKL exceeded expectations to win 15% in 1995, before crashing to
1.73 in 1998.

Like the contemporaneous DPS, the TKL captured the generally frustrated
mood of the Latvian electorate with a discourse harshly critical of the
political establishment (Pabriks & Štokenberga, 2006:59). Nissinen
(1999:139) claims that his rhetoric accused any political rival of being
a "communist", and tended not to discriminate among members of the
political establishment (he suggested that 80% of Latvian politicians
were "bandits"). The country's woes had not improved, he claimed,
because the old communist elite (the "devil") were still in power
(Nissinen, 1999:139) (OTH_POLCLASS = 3).

While the party was certainly nationalist, the role of ethnocentrism in
Siegerists party is difficult to pin down. He had a chequered history of
association with far right organisations in Germany, where he was
accused of race hatred offences (Davies & Ozolins, 1996:126). He was
also on record making a number of anti-Gypsy statements, and Učeň
(2007:52) categorises the party xenophobic (although without
explanation). Nonetheless, Nissinen convincingly argues that there was
not a lot of this in his 1995 platform, even if the media accused of
being far-right (1999:139-40). I've labelled him 2 on OTH_ETHNIC. There
is no evidence for anything registering on the OTH_IMMIGRANT variable.
With a generally pro-market neoliberal platform (Nissinen, 1999:136), it
did not antagonise the business/wealthy "other" (OTH_FINANCIAL = 1).
Likewise, according to Nissinen Siegerists was harchly critical of
Russia in his 1993 election, but shifted sharply to support greater ties
with Russia by 1995 (OTH_FOREIGN = 1)

The party has been called "non-ideological" (Balcere, 2013:95), but was
clearly right-wing on both economic policy and nationalist rhetoric
(Müller-Rommel and Nørgaard, 2001:31) (LRPOSITION = R). The party is
generally seen to be a vehicle for Siegerists' personality -- to the
extent that it is often called "Seigerists' Party" (Davies & Ozolins,
1996:126; see also Pettai and Kreuzer, 1999:156; Nissinen, 1999:136)
(CHARISMA = 3). Nissinen (1999:136) goes as far as calling it a
"personality cult" due to the synonymy between leader and party. Aside
from his flamboyant and controversial personality, his very conventional
campaign methods (handing out bananas to would-be voters) received
considerable press attention. Učeň (2007:52) categorises as
"authoritarian" without explanation, and other than the fact that
Seigerists had a generally domineering personality, I can't see any
reason to label the party greater than 1 for LIBDEMNORMS. Niether
Siegerists nor his party served in government (INSIDER = 1)

## Democratic Party Saimnieks 

Democratic Party Saimnieks ("Master", DPS) were a merger of the smaller
"Saimnieks" local party from Riga and the Democratic Centre party, who
united to contest the 1995 elections (Ikstens, 2003:5). It had ties to
both business elites and liberal communists from the old regime
(Nissinen, 1999:146). The party achieved a breakout 15% in those
elections and went on to govern in a coalition before collapsing in the
subsequent 1998 elections.

The party is almost universally described as populist in the literature
(see Učeň, 2007:59; Balcere, 2013:95). It campaigned in 1995 on a
vaguely anti-corruption, and anti-establishment platform in its breakout
1995 election (Auers, 2013:102), appealing to those who had lost out in
the market transitions (Auers & Kasekamp, 2013:239) and victims of a
recent major banking collapse (Pettai and Kreuzer, 1999:156). There is
not a lot available detailing the nature of the party's actual populist
rhetoric and allegations in 1995, and Nissinen (1999), whose text is
most detailed, seems to think that the party's populism was
significantly lighter than the likes of the Seigerists'. Hence I've
coded it 2 for OTH_POLCLASS.

The party has been variously called centre-right (Auers, 2013:88; Nakai,
2014:68), centrist (Stanley, 2017:149; Balcere, 2013:95), and centre
left (Nissinen, 1999:146; Gailbreath, 2006:387; Dreifelds, 1996:89). I
have placed its LR_POSITION coding at C, but this could be contested.
According to Auers & Kasekamp, (2013:239) corrupt businessmen were a
target of the party's populism, although Nissinen (1999:147) claims that
the party had significant links with the business class (particularly
Russian businesses) (see also Nakai, 2014:68). I have left the
OTH_FINANCIAL coding at 2. I've seen no evidence to register the party
on the OTH_ETHNIC, OTH_FOREIGN or OTH_IMMIGRANTS variables.

The party is not discussed in generally leader-centric terms (CHARISMA =
1), or in any way that threatened the democratic order (LIBDEMNORMS =
1). As the party was in a governing coalition from 1995, it is labelled
2 on INSIDER in the subsequent 1998 election.

## New Era 

New Era (*Jaunais Laiks*, JL) was formed in 2001 by the former Central
Bank Governor Einārs Repše to compete in the 2002 election. Its
anti-corruption rhetoric proved highly successful, with the party
winning those elections Einārs Repše becoming Prime Minister for a short
period before falling out with coalition partners. The party continued
surprisingly well in the next elections without him. It is often seen in
similar terms as the contemporaneous Res Publica party in neighbouring
Estonia.

Repše, a popular public figure at the time, claimed to be shocked by the
rates of corruption and mismanagement in the political system (Auers,
2002:106; Auers, 2018:352), and accused the country's incumbent elites
of betraying the national interests (Učeň, 2007:59; see also Stanley,
2017:150; Balcere, 2016). As its name suggests, it sold the electorate
an idea of "new politics" in which the slate would be wiped clean and a
new generation brought in (Sikk, 2009:7) (OTH_POLCLASS = 3). According
to Učeň (2007:59-60), the party maintained this anti-political
establishment stance even after forming government.

The party is usually considered centre-right (Učeň, 2007:59; Nakai,
2014:66) and neo-liberal (Sikk, 2006:133), or occasionally centrist
(Auers & Kasekamp, 2013:239). I've labelled it CR on LRPOSITION. In
accordance with its opposition to corruption, the party styled itself as
hostile to "oligarchs" (Auers, 2013:104; Nakai, 2014: 70) -- a term
which in Latvia refers to wealthy politicians rather than just wealthy
citizens (see Auers, 2013:103). Due to this precise meaning it could be
argued that the party should be labelled 1 on OTH_FINANCIAL -- I have
left it at 2 for now. The literature makes no reference to any stances
against OTH_ETHNIC, OTH_IMMIGRANTS, OTH_FOREIGN or OTH_MILITARY.

The party was generally considered to be based around Repše's
personality (Pabriks & Štokenberga, 2006:58; Sikk, 2006:153), and was
able to mobilise successfully without spending very much money (Sikk,
2006:141). As such it has been called a "one-man party" (Sikk, 2004:5)
(CHARISMA = 3). However, Repše resigned from its leadership in 2004, and
I have therefore dropped this to 1 for 2006. The party did not appear to
violate any LIBDEMNORMS. Given that New Era was founded by the former
head of the central bank, it would be wrong to label it a 1 on INSIDER
even though he was not formally in government, so I've placed the party
at 2 for its initial election, and 3 afterward (after Respse was Prime
Minister).

## TB-LNNK/National Alliance 

This entity is a complicated grouping of three separate parties. "For
Fatherland and Freedom" (*Tēvzemei un Brīvībai*/TB) and the Latvian
National Independence Movement (*Latvijas Nacionāls Neatkarības
kustība/*LNNK) were separate nationalist parties in the early 1990s that
merged in 1997. This party was right wing, and generally ethnocentric in
favour of the ethnically Latvian majority, but from the available
evidence does not seem to be a populist party (see Galbreath, 2006; and
Braghiroli & Petsinis, 2019; Auers & Kasekamp, 2013:239). This could be
reviewed however. In 2010, TB-LNNK allied with the far-right youth
movement cum political party All for Latvia! (Visu Latvijai!/VL) to form
a single list in the elections that year, and a formal party, the
National Alliance (NA), in 2011. The VL group had long criticised
TB-LNNK for selling out nationalist interests (Auers, 2010:3). According
to Auers and Kasekamp, the All for Latvia! Grouping effectively took
over the party after the merger. The National Alliance is usually
considered Latvia's first and so far only true populist radical right
party, and is often associated with the Estonian People's Conservative
Party (EKRE).

According to Auers (2018: 351), "The VL! Wing of the NA added anti-elite
populism to the existing nativism and authoritarianism of TB-LNNK, with
VL!s more youthful deputies regularly tweeting and using social media to
complain about the older parties' lack of respect for parliament". The
VL! had achieved this image via a unlimber of well-attended rallies in
the 2006 election (when they nonetheless failed to pass the 5%
threshold) that offered an "aggressive critique of the political elite"
(Auers & Kasekamp, 2013:239). While this suggests a 3 on OTH_POLCLASS,
Braghiroli & Petsinis, (2019) suggest that this rhetoric has been
checked since entering government after the 2011 elections, and hence I
have labelled it 3 for 2010 and 2011 and 2 since then. Further research
should clarify this.

While a general ethno-centric stance had been common among ethnic
Latvian parties in the immediate post-communist period, the increasing
acceptance of multiculturalism allowed the NA to claim that the national
elite had abandoned the ethnic majority (Braghiroli & Petsinis, 2019:4).
In the NA (and other parties) the most common target of this is the
Russian-speaking minority (Jakobson, 2012:47). Among numerous
controversial manifestations of this, it supported an annual march of
Waffen SS veterans, the limitation of the Russian language in the
private sphere (job advertisements for example) (Auers, 2010:5), and
commenced its 2011 manifesto with the line that "Latvians must feel at
home in their ethnic homeland" (Auers and Kasekamp, 2013:242; see also
Bennich-Björkman & Johansson, 2012). There are also credible accusations
of anti-Semitism in the party (Auers and Kasekamp, 2013:243) (OTH_ETHNIC
= 3). NA is staunchly opposed to refugees (Braghiroli & Petsinis, 2019)
(OTH_IMMIGRANT = 3), but this appears to only have become an issue after
the 2015 migrant crisis in Europe (see Auers & Kasekam, 2013:241), when
Latvia agreed to accept its quota. I have labelled the party 1 on this
variable before the crisis. The party is hostile to the influence of
both Russia and to a lesser extent the EU (Braghiroli & Petsinis,
2019:6). The party espouses a well-articulated "intermarium" theory that
attempts to maintain eastern European culture from threats emanating
from both east and west (OTH_FOREIGN = 3). I've seen no evidence that
the party is opposed to OTH_FINANCIAL (= 1).

The party is unambiguously radical right (Auers & Kasekamp, 2013:239)
(LRPOSITION = FR), and has violated a number of important democratic
norms, particularly by parading in military uniforms and celebrating the
memory of controversial pre-war dictator Karlis Ilmanis (Auers &
Kasekamp, 2013:243) (LIBDEMNORMS = 3). While backed by a strong and
somewhat independent party organisation (the old TB-LNNK), the NA is
strongly identified with its young and charismatic leader Raivis
Dzintars (Auers & Kasekamp, 2013:240) (CHARISMA = 2). Given that the
TB-LNNK was in government in the 1990s, and the NA itself was in
coalition government after the 2011 elections, I've labelled it 2 on
INSIDER.

## Zatlers Reform Party

The (September) 2011 election occurred so soon after the (December) 2010
because incumbent president Valdis Zatlers triggered a clause in the
constitution to recall parliament. He did this because he alleged that a
trio of oligarchs had taken control of the government: "At the moment we

can observe not just theft from state resources but a gradual
privatization of Latvian democracy" (cited in Auers, 2013:85). Zatlers
went on to form his own party to participate in the election, the
"Reform Party" (*Reformu partija*, RP), a.k.a "Zatler's Reform Party"
(ZRP).

As the name and context suggests, the central issue of the party was the
endemic corruption of the political class (OTH_POLCLASS = 3). It is a
somewhat difficult case because the party alleged that specific parties,
not all politicians, were corrupt, so there could be an argument that it
shouldn't feature in the dataset. However, available evidence suggests
that the 2011 election called by Zatler "almost exclusively focused
around corruption and the illicit influence of the oligarchs" (Auers,
2013:105), and that the party did talk about corruption in "systemic"
terms (Jakobson 2012:45). On this basis the party is often considered
populist (Auers, 2018:352; Auers & Kasekamp, 2013:245; Jakobson
2012:122). For its anti-oligarch stance, I've given it 3 on
OTH_FINANCIAL. There is some evidence that the party opposed Russian
influence in Latvia (Jakobson, 2012:49), but not to the extent to
register on OTH_FOREIGN.

The party appears to be centre right (LR_POSITION = CR) but this should
be confirmed. The party was based on the personality of Zatler himself
(Jakobson et al 2012:) (CHARISMA = 3), and seems not to have threatened
democratic norms (LIBDEMNORMS = 1). Zatler was President of Latvia, but
given that this position is not the head of government in Latvia, I've
coded that party 2 on INSIDER.

## For Latvia from the Heart 

For Latvia from the Heart (*No sirds Latvijai/*NSL) was founded by
former auditor general Ingunda Sudraba, famed for tackling the
"oligarch's" whose influence in politics her party opposed. Not a lot is
written about the party other than the fact that it is generally
considered right wing (Braghiroli & Petsinis, 2019:16; Kneuer, 2019:37)
(LRPOSITION = CR), that it campaigned on an anti-corruption message
(Eihmanis, 2019:258; Cianetti, 2014:3), and that her campaign took a hit
from a video of her having lunch with a Russian "oligarchs" in question.
Nonetheless, NSL picked up 6.8% in the 2014 election, before cratering
to less than 1% in 2018. For her anti-oligarch stance I've labelled her
2 on OTH_FINANCIAL.

Sudraba is considered by [NAME]{.mark} a "charismatic longtime critic of
Latvia's bureaucratic apparatus and political leadership" (Bukovskis &
Sprūds) (OTH_POLCLASS = 3). There appears to be nothing to the party
other than its leader (CHARISMA = 3), and there is no evidence for
anything registering on any other variable. I do not consider her
position as auditor general as being an INSIDER (= 1).

## Who owns the state? (KPV-LV) 

Who owns the State? (*Kam Pieder Valsts?* KPV-LV is another
anti-establishment party, founded by independent MP Artuss Kaimiņš, a
former actor who became well known for filming parliamentary proceedings
and posting them online to show problems in the political system
(Balcere, 2016: Auers, 2018:352). The party's message is that the
political establishment -- politicians and civil servants -- is corrupt
and that existing parties waste taxpayers\' money (Kaža, 2018; Auers,
2018:352) (OTH_POLCLASS = 3). Recent scandals in the political and
banking sectors (Higgins 2018) helped the party surge to second place in
the 2018 elections only two years after its foundation, performing
particularly well among diasporic communities (Arroque, 2018). It formed
coalition government after those elections.

The party is moderately anti-EU (Higgins 2018) (OTH_FOREIGN = 2), but,
from what I can tell, does not hold many traditionally far-right
positions against OTH_ETHNIC and OTH_IMMIGRANTS. Available evidence
suggests that it is conservative (LRPOSITION = CR) although it seems
somewhat similar to the Five Star Movement in Italy in its deliberately
non-ideological identity (Petsinis, 2019), focusing only on hostility to
the political class. It is also heavily reliant on Kaimiņš\'
confrontational personality (Arroque 2018; Kaza 2016; Bukovskis &
Sprūds, 2019) (CHARISMA = 3). Given his threats to "personally fire"
journalists who upset him (Higgins, 2018), KPV-LV constitutes a mild
threat to liberal democratic norms (LIBDEMNORMS = 2). It has not been
any kind of INSIDER.
