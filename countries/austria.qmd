## Austrian Freedom Party

The Austrian Freedom Party (*Freiheitliche Partei Österreichs*, FPÖ)
traces its roots back to organisations representing former Nazis
disenfranchised in Austria's initial post-war elections. After founding
as a party in 1956 its first two leaders were former Nazis and the party
carried an illiberal taboo in the party system (Fallend 2012, 116--17).
With an ideologically ambiguous character, it participated in several
minority governments before 1980, and strived to moderate its
controversial image. We see no evidence that it was populist by our
definition in the 1983 election, so we've included it in the dataset
only from 1986, when Jörg Haider took it over and moved the party to the
hard right in policy and rhetoric (most authors agree that this is when
it should be classified as populist, see: Van Kessel 2015, 35;
Heinrisch, 2013, 47; Fallend 2012, 117; McGann and Kitschelt 2005, 151).
After improving its electoral performance through the 1990s the FPÖ
joined a coalition government with the centre right ÖVP between 2000 and
2005, following which Haider split off to form his own party (BZÖ) that
took the FPÖ's spot in the coalition. The FPÖ then became a new
opposition party under the leadership of one of Haider's former mentees
Heinze-Christian Strache, who gradually rebuilt its following to peak at
26% in the 2017 election, after which it again formed coalition
government with the ÖVP. After Strache was caught on tape dealing
corruptly with an undercover journalist (the "Ibiza Affair") he was
forced to leave politics, and the party's vote dropped to 16% in the
2019 elections.

Haider converted the FPÖ into a protest vehicle that tapped into the
dissatisfaction with the political system. A cornerstone of this was his
opposition to "partitocracy" of the dominant national parties, the SPÖ
and ÖVP (McGann and Kitschelt 2005, 151). Haider's rhetoric projected a
system in which a "ruling class" (cited in Wodak 2013, 23) was both
homogenous and fundamentally separate from the ordinary people (Bauböck
2009, 243). He accused this political elite of enjoying embedded
privileges that allowed them to line their own pockets at the expense of
ordinary people (Höbelt 2003, 56). In Betz's words, the FPÖ:

> pursued 'a strategy of system change' intended to liberate the
> ordinary citizen from the political parties... Its self-proclaimed
> goal was to solve what it saw as one of Austria\'s most urgent
> political problems, namely citizens' growing alienation from the
> state, by engineering Austria\'s transition from a 'party state' to a
> 'citizens' democracy. (Betz 2001, 401)

Even when the party was in government, Haider continued this stance by
fashioning himself into a kind of internal "opposition" within the
coalition (Heinrisch, 2013, 51). After Haider stepped down from the
leadership the party appears to have maintained this stance (see
Heinisch, Werner, and Habersack 2020; Wodak and Forchtner 2014). Stache,
for example, has alleged that the government deliberately allowed for
the asylum system to be abused in order to tend to the interests of the
"asylum industry" at the expense of the people (Ajanovic, Mayer, and
Sauer 2018, 13). For this we have coded the party 3 on OTH_POLCLASS for
the duration of its time in the dataset.

Soon after taking control of the party Haider made antipathy to
immigrants and ethnic others a core component of its discourse and
agenda under an "Austria first" platform. Initially his ethnocentric
rhetoric was largely based in antisemitic comments and symbolism (at one
point he alleged that he was a victim of a "Jewish" smear campaign, see:
Heinrisch, 2013, 63), and included other forms of xenophobia (McGann and
Kitschelt 2005, 151--63). The party succeeded in mobilising against
immigration and asylum seekers in the context of the crisis in the
Bulkans in the early Haider days, but from the 1990s dramatically turned
its attention to Muslim migrants (Fallend 2012, 118), whom it considered
as a cultural threat to the nation, a drain on the welfare system, and a
source of crime and radicalism (Heinrisch, 2013, 62--63). Strache has
maintained this "virulently anti-Muslim" posture (Turner-Graham 2008,
181), with the party campaigning against "invading Muslim hordes" (Wodak
and Forchtner 2014, 239) and conflating immigration with crime under his
leadership. We've therefore coded the FPÖ 3 on both OTH_ETHNIC and
OTH_IMMIGRANT.

There was a clear anti-foreign element to Haider's Austria First
rhetoric, and at one point he targeted the "Brussels mafia" during
debates about European integration in the 1990 (though he ended up
supporting membership) (Hockenos 1995, 76). The party then took an
anti-EU line in the 2000s on the slogan "People's Representatives
instead of EU-Traitors" (Turner-Graham 2008, 197). By the late 2010s (or
possibly earlier), Strache and other party leaders claimed that the
government was a "stooge" of European Commission, "agents" of the EU,
and "the parrot of Merkel" (Heinisch, Werner, and Habersack 2020, 171).
This appears to be an elevation of OTH_FOREIGN rhetoric, and hence we've
coded the party 3 on this variable from 2016 and 2 before then, although
the timing of this shift could be investigated further. We've seen
nothing that indicates any hostility to the military (OTH_MLITARY = 1).

Haider was clearly a very effective and charismatic leader (Hockenos
1995, 76) (Murphy 2004, 306), known for performatively braking taboos
surrounding political correctness (Betz 2001, 407). Strache appears to
have modelled his own image on Haider (Heinrisch, 2013, 52), and has
been just as important to the FPÖ's image as Haider was (Heinrisch,
2013, 57). Due to the strong influence of its leaders the FPÖ has been
called a "leader cult" (Bailer 2018). However the party clearly has an
institutional history that goes beyond its leaders (Heinrisch, 2013,
65), and has withstood multiple leadership transitions. We have
therefore coded it as 2 on CHARISMA.

The party\'s economic agenda is complicated (see Heinrisch, 2013, 64),
but it has generally remained liberal and deregulatory, despite the
occasional comment against international capitalism. There are also
elements of liberal or libertarian ideas in its policies (McGann and
Kitschelt 2005, 152; Rathgeb 2021, 646). We\'ve kept the OTH_ECONOMIC
variable at 1 and coded it FR in LRPOSITION due to the salience of its
cultural majoritarianism.

The FPÖ (even well before Haider's arrival) had a clearly illiberal
image within Austria due to their linkage to former Nazis (Fallend 2012,
115). Haider's right wing majoritarian and ethnocentric rhetoric clearly
re-established this image, as has his (and Strache's) various
associations with far-right groups in their youth. The party's calls for
a more direct and republican democratic model have also been viewed as
illiberal in this context (see Adamson 2010, 156). However we've not
found any evidence that party has linked the party's actions or policies
to violations of liberal democratic norms in the institutional sense.
We've coded it 2 for LIBDEMNORMS due to its Nazi lineage, but this could
be investigated more. We've coded the party 2 on INSIDER in each
election since 2000, after which it formed a coalition government with
the ÖVP.

## Alliance for the Future of Austria

The Alliance for the Future of Austria (*Bündnis Zukunft Österreich*,
BZÖ) was formed when Haider reacted to discontent with the FPÖ\'s
grassroots and split the parliamentary group off from the party. He
served as leader of the new party, and sought a relatively more moderate
orientation that was more open to forming government (Heinrisch, 2013,
48). Although most of the far right policies are similar to the FPÖ, it
is difficult to decide whether these differences would manifest on a 1-3
scale. Given that the party was led by Haider, we've coded it the same
as FPÖ in the one election in which it scored above 5% (2008). The
exception to this is the CHARISMA variable, given that the new party was
formed around Haider.

## Team Stronach

Founded in 2012, Team Stronach (TS) was a vehicle for Canadian-Austrian
billionaire Frank Stronach. An "entrepreneurial party" backed
financially by Stronach and linked to his business (Heinisch and
Saxonberg 2017, 210), TS spent heavily in the election and recruited
several BZÖ MPs to form a parliamentary caucus before the election. It
won 5.7 % in the election, narrowly making it past the 4% threshold to
enter parliament, but dissolved into infighting soon afterward and did
not participate in the 2017 election.

Stronach's central campaign theme was his "radical anti-establishment"
hostility towards the political class (Hloušek, Kopeček, and Vodová
2020, 96), whom he considered fundamentally corrupt (Dolezal and
Zeglovits 2014, 646; Schmuck, Matthes, and Boomgaarden 2016, 88; Van
Kessel 2015, 35; Brett 2013, 411). Stronach's rhetoric crafted
politicians as self-serving and categorically estranged from the
interests and experiences of citizens (Hloušek, Kopeček, and Vodová
2020, 98). This is well-captured by one of his catch phrases: "the
politicians want to serve themselves. I want to serve Austria" (Luther
2014, 24) (OTH_POLCLASS = 3). According to several sources, Stronach
also targeted business elites and banks (especially in the context of
the Euro debt crisis) (Hloušek, Kopeček, and Vodová 2020, 98),
considering them an element of the corrupt "system" alongside
politicians (Luther 2014, 25). As this appears somewhat narrow we've
coded him 2 on OTH_ECONOMIC = 2. Euroscepticism was also a key part of
his narrative (Hloušek, Kopeček, and Vodová 2020, 98; Dolezal and
Zeglovits 2014, 645), albeit not quite to the level that would warrant a
3 on OTH_FOREIGN (= 2). We've seen nothing that indicates any hostility
to the military (OTH_MILITARY = 1).

Stronach's central policy platform was economic neoliberalism, stressing
his business credentials and a managerial approach to governance
(Hloušek, Kopeček, and Vodová 2020, 95). He did not target immigrants
(Heinrisch, 2013, 49; Dolezal and Zeglovits 2014, 645), or make
xenophobic statements (Brett 2013, 411) (OTH_ETHNIC = 1, OTH_IMMIGRANTS
= 1). Given the salience of his economic liberalism he has been
generally positioned on the ideological right (Schmuck, Matthes, and
Boomgaarden 2016, 86) (LRPOSITION = R). Although Stronach had a number
of somewhat authoritarian law and order positions (including advocating
the return of the death penalty), we've not seen enough evidence to
consider his campaign a threat to liberal democratic norms (LIBDEMNORMS
= 1). As its name suggests, the party was Stronach's "personal project"
(Hloušek, Kopeček, and Vodová 2020, 95) and relied on his charisma
(Heinisch and Saxonberg 2017, 220). Media coverage also focused far more
on Frank Stronach than on his party (Hloušek, Kopeček, and Vodová 2020,
97), and there appeared to be no organisational coherence other that his
leadership (CHARISMA = 3). Stronach did not serve in any government
before the campaign (INSIDER = 1).
