<p>Electoral competition has not been free in Russia in the Putin era, and there are numerous candidates who have not been allowed to stand, some of whom are arguably populists (Alexei Navalny for example). Corresponding election boycotts should also be taken into consideration when looking at trends.</p>
<section id="vladirim-zhirinovsky-liberal-democratic-party" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="vladirim-zhirinovsky-liberal-democratic-party">Vladirim Zhirinovsky / Liberal Democratic Party</h2>
<p>The Liberal Democratic Party of Vladmir Zhirinovsky has been a feature of Russian politics since the end of the USSR. Having been a critic of the ruling Communist Party in its last decade in power, Zhirinovsky was a candidate in the first democratic elections in 1991, where he was a notably flamboyant “common folk” opposition to the standard boring communist politician (Eatwell, 2002:6). His campaign featured populist measures about fighting crime, cutting the price of vodka, and finding husbands for unmarried women (Kipp, 1994:74; Eatwell, 2002:6). He also developed a radically ethno-nationalist stance (Kipp, 1994:77), advoating re-conquering the former imperial lands of the old Russian Empire (and even more by conquering Iran and Afghanistan) (Koman, 1996) and praises of Hitler (Eatwell, 2002:7), combined with a chauvinistic measure of racism, anti-semitism, anti-Islam and sexism (Alexeev, 2006:211). He measured 3 on the OTH_FOREIGN for his opinions of the West, post-soviet successor states in the CIS, neighbouring Islamic states (Turkey and Iran in particular), and China (Koman, 1996; Alexeev, 2006:212). I’ve seen no evidence that his politics has exhibited any OTH_FINANCIAL elements, and according to Eatwell (2002:7) business elites were a source of support for the LDP in its early years. The LDP’s economic platform has been characterised as a kind of state-capitalism supportive of privatisation (Kipp, 1994:79).</p>
<p>While the party has well-defined ideological foundations, the flamboyant, controversial, and media-savy personality of Zhirinovsky has clearly been paramount in holding the party together (CHARISMA = 3) (Kipp, 1994:86; Eatwell, 2002:7), especially considering that it has rivals on the far right. I’ve labelled his OTH_POLCLASS score as high in initial elections but receding from around the 1995 election, as it seemed that this peaked in the initial post-communist era. Over the years he’s become so stable and unthreatening in the party system that he could hardly the anti-establishment figure that he used to be. Behind the scenes he seems to have worked reasonably closely with both Yeltsin (Eatwell, 2002:9) and Putin (Colton &amp; Hale 2014). Colton and Hale even suggest that Zhirinovski is Putin’s “officially tolerated nationalist”, given that the absorbes some protest votes while remaining cooperative (2014:7). He is somewhat difficult to characterise on LIBDEMNORMS given the fragile state of these norms in Russia. In spite of this, I’ve labelled him 3 throughout his career given his vocal suggestions that his desired reconstituted Russian Empire requires centralised political control with no separation of powers (Kipp, 1994:77).</p>

<section id="alexander-lebed" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="alexander-lebed">Alexander Lebed</h2>
<p>Alexander Lebed, a former general who ran for president in 1996 under the <strong>Congress of Russian Communities</strong> party, is a tricky one to characterise. He ran a generally centre-right campaign with a common-man “outsider” appeal grounded in general sense of Russian nationalism linked to his military service (particularly in Moldova, where he favoured the ethnic Russians in Transnistria in defiance of more moderate orders from Moscow) (Phillips, 1997). However his populist appeal was based on his incorruptable image, rather than that of a controversial firebrand figure like Zhirinovsky (Phillips, 1997; Hale, 2006:75). This was bult in part on his open criticism of the corruption of superiors (“thieves”) in the military and defence bureaucracy (Simonsen, 1995:538). He also accused the political class of selling out to the west – unlike former corrupt statesmen who looted from imperial territories and brought it back to Russia, “our contempporarys in the other hand do their robberies at home and bring the loot abroad. Here heads have to roll, mercilessly” (Simonsen, 1995:543). While this is clearly evidence of OTH_POLCLASS rhetoric, this seems not to have escalated beyond a 2 on our scale. His political platform was based on a strong nationalist streak critical of the West’s treatment of post-soviet Russia (Simonsen, 1995:540), although his opposition to OTH_FOREIGN did not reach the scale of Zhirinovski or Putin (2).</p>
<p>While Lebed seems like a supporter of democratic institutions, his controversial praise for the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet in Chile, and the fact that he defended the comment by praising Rissian dictatorships from Peter the Great to Stalin, (Simonsen, 1995:542) suggest that he was a mild threat to LIBDEMNORMS (2). His candidacy was clearly centred no his personal saviour image (CHARISMA=3), and I have not seen evidence of any significant OTH_IMMIGRANTS or OTH_ETHNIC discourse. I have not seen evidence for any OTH_FINANCIAL populist politics, although further research should confirm this. After serving in Yeltsin’s cabinet after the 1996 election (from which he was fired), he served as governor of Krasnoyarsk Krai, and elected not to run for president against Putin in 2000 despite expectations that he would. He died in a plane crash in 2002</p>
</section>
<section id="vladimir-putin-unity-united-russia" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="vladimir-putin-unity-united-russia">Vladimir Putin / Unity / United Russia</h2>
<p>Vladimir Putin’s form of populism (and that of his Unity and United Russia party) is tricky to explain. By some accounts he did not run as a populist in his initial election in 2000, but introduced populist rhetoric gradually in the mid-2000s (following the ‘colour’ revolutions in the CIS and the Iraq War) and especially after the 2011-12 election cycle (when Putin’s economic narrative was hit by the 2008 econoomic crisis) (Robinson 2017; Robinson and Milne 2017). Around the time of his first re-election in 2004, he started to develop a “sovereign democracy” rhetoric that defined Russian nationalism as distinct from the western world, and Putin as the undisputed savoir preventing the return of Yeltsen-era instability, incompetance and weakness (Casula 2013; Robinson and Milne 2017:). When Putin returned to the presidency in after a one-term hiatus 2012, this rhetoric of anti-western nationalism in was ramped up and combined with a ‘cultural turn’ (anti-LGBT laws, strengthened ties to the Orthodox Church, etc.) (Robinson 2017) that have created what many consider to be an official ‘strongman’ populism today.</p>
<p>There is a common argument that Putin’s portrayal of the political elite and the state bureaucracy constitutes what we would register as OTH_POLCLASS populism. There is some evidence of this kind of populism: Unity, for example, denied that it was even a party, saying instead that it was merely an association of people fed up with seeing others decide their fate (Eatwell, 2002:10). Likewise, UR has stated that it represents merely “common sense” and that it “transcends ideological myths” associated with other politicians and corrupt lethargy of bureaucrats (Casula 2013:5, 7). These are all examples of distancing the part and its leaders from other politicians. On the other hand, some claim that Putin’s origins as an insider run contrary to his portrayal as a true populist. Lassila (2018) goes as far as arguing that Russia’s historical experience has produced a unique distrust in “the people” as a political agent, and suggests instead that Putin be considered a non-populist autocrat. At a minimum, it is not clear that Putin has engaged in any explicit OTH_POLCLASS rhetoric, and hence for now this is left at 1 throughout his tenure. This should be reviewed.</p>
<p>Putin has never envoked any OTH_FINANCIAL, OTH_IMMIGRANT, OTH_ETHNIC or OTH_MILITARY populist rhetoric to registers on our variables. His most important “other” is clearly OTH_FOREIGN, which I have labelled as 1 initially, escalating to 2 by the 2003-4 election period, and reaching 3 by the 2011-12 election period. Putin was obviously an INSIDER from the beginning, just as Unity was created as a party of power. LIBDEMNORMS are somewhat tricky given that these were never particularlystrnog t begin with in Russia. However it seems fitting to label Putin/UR 2 from his beginnings and escalate this to 3 by the 2011-12 period given its increasingly authoritarian and autocratic nature. The most difficult of all the variables here is CHARISMA. Unity was clearly built around the ambitions of Putin and were dependent on his personality, and many have argued that Putin has acted as the “empty signifier” of his and his party’s brand of populism (Casula 2013:7). However it is debatable that Putin’s populism was a personality-dependent form during his rise in 2000. An argument could be made that Putin was simply popular based on his political skills and image as a relatively competent manager. I’ve labelled the party 3 from its inception, but this should be reviewed.</p>

<section id="rodina" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="rodina">Rodina</h2>
<p>Rodina (“motherland”) was allegedly created by the Kremlin to syphon votes from the Communist Party in 2003 (Varga, 2004; Hale 2006), but soon showed an independent direction. Its original message was left wing and nationalist (OTH_FINANCIAL=3), campaigning to reverse privatisations from the 1990s and nationalise other assets. However it became better known for its radical anti-immigrant advertising that included suggestions that ethnic Russians needed to clean “garbage” from their cities (Varga, 2008:570) (OTH_IMMIGRANT=3, OTH_ETHNIC=3). For this reason it has been characterised mainly as a far right party even though it had solid left credentials. This ideological position should be investigated further. Authorities took the unprecedented step of banning the party for this rhetoric in 2005. Little is written about the group in English, so these codings need to be reviewed. The party merged withseveral others to create the “Just Russia” Party, another more consistently left-wing party with ties to the Kremlin. March (2009:518) considers this party to alo be populist (against local bureaucrats but not Putin), but more research should confirm this, for now it is not included.</p>
