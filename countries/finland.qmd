# Case notes

## Finnish Rural Party

The Finnish Rural Party (*Suomen maaseudun puolue,* SMP) was a populist
agrarian protest party founded around Veikko Vannamo that mobilised
mainly on corruption, and the general context of urban
industrialisation/rural decline (Sänkiaho 1971; Arter 2012, 816). SMP
formed as a splinter of the Agrarian League in 1959.

The party espoused an anti-establishment populist line aimed at rallying
"forgotten" rural voters, frustrated with the "urban elite" (Lahti and
Palonen 2023, 130), and losing out in the rapid period of urbanisation
and industrialisation (Norocel 2016, 43; Arter 2012, 813). In
particular, the party took aim at the long serving government of
President Urho Kekkonen, the ruling group of political parties, and
Russian influence especially (Arter 2010, 486) (OTH_POLCLASS = 3,
OTH_FOREIGN = 2). As Ylä-Anttila put it: "The enemy was the political
and economic elite in the cities, 'the money power', which Vennamo
famously referred to as 'crime lords'" (Ylä-Anttila 2017, 25). This
opposition to corrupt business interests -- particularly its opposition
to "monopoly capitalism" (Sänkiaho 1971, 40) -- seems strong enough to
warrant 3 on OTH_ECONOMIC. We cannot see any evidence that the party was
nativist in the sense of OTH_ETHNIC or OTH_IMMIGRANT (1).

It was reliant on the leadership of Vennamo (Ylä-Anttila 2017, 25) even
after his son formally took over in (it was a "family business" in this
sense, (Arter 2012, 813)) (CHARISMA = 3). The party joined government
after the 1983 election (INSIDER = 2 1987-) against the objections of
the elder Vennamo.

## The Finns Party/ True Finns 

The Finns Party (*Perussuomalaiset*, PS), sometimes called the "True
Finns", is a nativist anti-immigration and anti-EU party, built largely
on the legacy of the SMP (Raunio 2013, 133; Arter 2012) and led by Timo
Soini for most of its life. Its breakout election came in 2011, when it
was the only anti-EU party in parliament and therefore positioned to
capitalise on the widespread anger at Finland's participation in the
bailout of southern European countries. After Jussi Halla-aho took the
leadership in a "hardliner coup" in 2017, the party's more moderate wing
split off to form the Blue Reform group in the 2019 election. The
Halla-aho-led Finns however maintained their vote share, receiving
17.5%.

PS self identifies as "populist" and criticises the "old
parties"/"cartel parties" in its championing of "forgotten" (a term
popularised by the SMP) ordinary people (Raunio 2013, 139; Norocel 2016;
Arter 2010, 488--89). The "elite" also constitute the broad yolk of
peripheral influences on the political system, as encompassed by Soini's
statement: "book-learned theoreticians, arrogant bureaucrats,
cold-hearted technocrats, uncomprehending centralizers, big-money
worshippers and smooth avant-garde thinkers do not trust the people.
They do not value the people's views because they believe the people are
stupid and indifferent and that all wisdom rests with the experts and an
elite that is divorced from everyday life" (cited in Arter 2010, 489).
Halla-aho has maintained this anti-elite hostility towards the "old
parties" (Raunio 2019, 179) (OTH_POLCLASS = 3).

PS is also explicitly ethno-centric in its identification of the
"people", more so than the SMP (Arter 2012, 817). While this related to
touchstone issues like the teaching of Swedish in schools as a second
language and opposition to American television on public airwaves, its
primary manifestation was the party's opposition to immigrants and
asylum seekers, against whom the party deployed nativist and welfare
chauvinist attitudes (Arter 2010, 499; 2012, 815; Pyrhönen 2013).
According to several authors however (Arter 2010, 485; Raunio 2013,
146), the party's approach to immigration and ethnocentrism is not as
extreme as other far-right parties in Europe, and the political
establishment and EU elites have formed a more important "other" (Niemi
2013). According to Wahlbeck, ethnocentrism in the party's rhetoric
takes the form of defense of the majority more than opposition to a
minority (Wahlbeck 2016). Norocel (2016:45) suggests that the precise
identity of the party on these matters is complicated by divisions
between its agrarian/conservative faction (including former SMP members,
and leader Soini) and a more xenophobic, anti-immigrant and far-right
one led by Jussi Halla-aho and several of the more controversial members
(Norocel 2017, 45; see also Kuisma 2013). There is also some evidence
that the party's stance on these issues has hardened over time (Arter
2010, 498). Under Halla-aho, the party was seen to take a more hard-line
anti-immigration views (Borg 2019, 187; Raunio 2019, 176; Arter 2010).
While its precise profile is therefore debatable and ambiguous, we've
coded it 2 on OTH_IMMIGRANTS and 2 on OTH_ETHNIC Under Soini, and
increased OTH_IMMIGRANTS to 3 under Halla-aho.

PS has been consistently opposed to the EU and builds this opposition
into its populist approach (Lähdesmäki 2015). As the party programme
once stated: "The EU is a project for filthy rich capitalists which
tries to fill the pockets of major owners of capital while creating a
valueless Europe where only money matters" (cited in Raunio 2013, 143).
Soini dubbed the 2011 election "a referendum on the EU" (Arter 2012,
816). Given the primacy of the EU in the parties identity (especially
since the post-bailout 2011 election), this warrants 3 on OTH_FOREIGN.

PS has a somewhat confusing economic ideology (Kuisma 2013, 94), in that
it opposes the bureaucratic red tape of government regulation, yet calls
for a strong, interventionist welfare state to safeguard the common
citizen against big business and multinationals (OTH_ECONOMIC = 3)
(Raunio 2013, 139; see also Arter 2010, 496; 2012, 815). While this
could be debated, we have concluded that the party's ethno-nationalism
qualifies it as essentially right-wing (LRPOSITION = R)
(Kestilä-Kekkonen and Söderlund 2014, 643). While they call for reforms
of democracy, this entails an increase in transparency, and the party
does not oppose liberal democratic norms as we are measuring them
(Raunio 2013, 140; Arter 2010, 490) (LIBDEMNORMS = 1). The party has
been led by Timo Soini until he left in 2017, and was quite dependent on
his leadership (Kestilä-Kekkonen and Söderlund 2014; Niemi 2012; 2013).
According to Arter, Soini's presidential candidacy in 2006 was a key
source of early publicity for the party, and he acted as its 'trump
card' ever since (Arter 2010, 488). According to Raunio, Halla-aho was
able to keep this leader-centrism going in the 2019 vote (Raunio 2019,
180) (CHARISMA = 3). As the party joined government in 2015, we have
labelled it 2 on INSIDER for these elections.
