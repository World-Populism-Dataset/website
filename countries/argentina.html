<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="carlos-menem">Carlos Menem</h2>
<p>Argentina suffered a coup by the military that overthrew the Peronist government of Isabel Perón and imposed a military dictatorship. The first free elections after the coup took place in 1983 and Raul Alfonsín became president until 1989, when he was succeeded by Carlos Menem. Carlos Menem is a complicated figure. Most authors agree that he won the 1989 election running a campaign based on the traditional Peronist discourse articulated around the concepts of “salariazo” and “the revolution of production” (Burdman, 2008: 10). In this victory speech, for instance, Menem proclaimed his was the victory of the “heroic march of national unity to be protagonist of a historic battle that all Argentinians must undertake ... against privileges, against vested interests, against speculators and usurers, against those who seek that nothing changes so that misery, underdevelopment, poverty and hunger continue in the Argentinian Republic” (Menem, 1989b). He also proclaimed that “my only compromise is to achieve the happiness of the Argentinian people and the greatness of the fatherland” (Menem, 1989b). Hawkins and Rovira Kaltwasser (2017) argue that his 1989 campaign indeed showed signs of a Manichean division between the elite and the people.</p>
<p>Fair (2011: 2) argues that Menem initiated a timid dialogue with the military, stressed the need for peace and hinted that he would <mark>indult</mark> the military, as he later did. Menem stressed his commitment to democracy by arguing that they, as opposed to the radical party, were the only ones holding primary elections in their party (Menem, 1989a). Burdam (2008: 13) argues that although Menem stressed the need to achieve economic independence this did not meant, as it did with Perón, freedom from the dependence vis-à-vis the UK, but simply the modernization of the economy and the level of production, without addressing who owns the capital. Therefore, I have coded 1 for military, LD norms violation and Foreign Interests.</p>
<p>However, Menem quickly shifted his economic discourse and embraced neoliberal policies devoted to control inflation. This fact has sparked the debate on Menem’s populism. For those authors who defend a more substantive definition of populism (Hawkins and Rovira Kaltwasser, 2017; Levitsky, 2003) Menem should not be considered populist after 1989. Neoliberal policies are considered to be opposed to neoliberalism and Menem is portrayed as betraying its previous populist stance. Moreover, Hawkins and Rovira Kaltwasser (2017) find little Manichean discourse between the elite and the people in his 1995 campaign. For authors that define populism based on personalism, a direct connection with the people, concentration of power and transgressing liberal political norms (Weyland, 2003: 6, 1996; Wehner, 2004) and less on substantive elements, neoliberalism and populism have a number of synergies. These include low levels of institutionalization, targeting unorganized poor, distancing themselves from unions, professional organizations and business groups and the use of the state to push through reform against opposition (Weyland, 2003: 2-3). Menem presented itself as a courageous leader that attacked the crisis head-on and thus deliver the country from hyperinflation demonstrating and reinforced his charisma (Weyland, 2003: 4). This author argues that “when the country confronted a deep open crisis and neoliberals prescribed the shock therapy of drastic market reform, they relied on the boldness and transgressive tendencies of neo-populist leaders to carry out this plan of action” (Weyland 2003: 5). Moreover, it was this boldness in the initial crisis what may explain their downfall as inflation lost importance compared to unemployment and growth, areas where neoliberal policies fare less well (Weyland 2003; Wehner, 2004). This understanding of the connection of neoliberalism and neo-populism is not very far from Hall’s and Jacques’s (1983) understanding of the politics of Thatcher.</p>
<p>Wehner (2004: 41) attributes Menem’s 1995 reelection to the relatively good results of his neoliberal economic policies. High inflation had been huge problem during Alfonsín’s government and, although poverty and employment did not improve, Menem’s ability to control inflation was rewarded by the Argentinian voters (Wehner, 2004: 46). In government, he had proclaimed an amnesty to militaries involved in the dictatorship and promoted close relationships with the EEUU in what was known as “relaciones carnales” through, for example, participating in the invasion to Kuwait (Botta, 2012: 157).</p>
<p>I have coded Menem in 1989. However, I have finally ruled against including him the rest of his years in government due to its lack of Manichean distinction between elite and people and his more pluralist understanding of politics.</p>

<section id="néstor-kirchner" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="néstor-kirchner">Néstor Kirchner</h2>
<p>In 2001, Argentina suffered a very strong economic and political crisis provoked by the “corralito” (which severely restricted people's ability to withdraw cash from banks). Widespread anger against the political system was summed in the motto "All of them must go!" (“¡Que se vayan todos!”). The election of Néstor Kirchner in 2003 as president of Argentina can be seen as the political outcome of that crisis. Néstor ran a campaign based on an opposition to the “old political class” and the “Fatherland’s enemies” (Padoan, 2017: 533; Fernández, 2010: 205). He argued for a radical change in the political system, the retrieval of the traditional Peronists goals of “Economic Independency”, “Political Sovereignty” and “Social Justice” (Padoan, 2017: 533) and criticized the Peronists of the 1990s for not delivering their promises and betraying Perón (Kirchner, 2003). Néstor condemned harshly the human rights abuses of the military dictatorship and the presidents before him for not prosecuting their crimes. Thus, once in government, he revoked the “Law of Due Obedience” and the “Full Stop law” and renewed the military hierarchy because the previous one was seen as part of the establishment (Fernández, 2010: 202). I have coded 3 for political class and for military.</p>
<p>Economically, Néstor argued forcefully against the neoliberal reforms that Menem had implemented in the previous decade. Kirchner proclaimed the need to rethink the economic system and, in his investment speech, talked about constructing a “National capitalism” (Kirchner, 2003b; Padoan, 2017: 533). The central issue in his economic and international policies was the payment of Argentina’s debt. Argentina had accrued a huge debt problem and Néstor’s solution consisted mainly on restructuring it. He famously proclaimed that “the creditors have to understand that they will only get paid if Argentina performs well” (Kirchner, 2003b; Fernández, 2010: 206). He managed to restructure 76% of the debt in 2005 and then Cristina did it again in 2010 up to 92% (Fernández de Kirchner, 2014). The main construction of a foreign enemy was done precisely on this point. Kirchnerism focuses less on attacks on specific foreign others but calls into question the whole international economic system that promotes neoliberal policies. Therefore, their attacks are mainly directed towards international economic institutions such as the IMF and against the financial elite (both national and international) who is blamed for pressuring in favor of policies that damage “the people” (Fernández, 2010). In Cristina’s presidency this opposition to foreign intervention was exemplified by the conflict over US judge Thomas Griesa’ decision over the payment of the debt to creditors.</p>
<p>There is no important ethnic other for Kirchnerism and immigrants have not been identified as the enemy of the people. In fact, Cristina has had a welcoming stance towards immigration (Irigaray, 2014). In order to underlie that their opposition to foreign interest are intrinsically connected with their economic position and not with specific enemy countries, I have marked a 3 for Financial and Foreign Interests, 1 for Immigration and Ethnic Other and “left-wing” as political ideology.</p>
<p>Néstor Kirchner was an unknown governor of a province when, in 2003, he launched his campaign (code 1 for insider populism in 2003). He was endorsed by exiting president Eduardo Duhalde, in a move to stop Carlos Menem from winning. He started with a 6% share in the polls and ended with a 22%. Thus, the social demand for a left-wing protest party produced by the devastating effects of the “corralito” may explain better Kirchner’s success than his charisma. However, the personality cult around Kirchner should not be discarded and “kirchnerism” became the name for the specific branch of populism developed by Néstor and Cristina. Moreover, Kirchner won the election with a party coalition (Front for Victory) and later constructed its party support not just from the traditional Justicialist Party, but from a very diverse mix of groups, governors and people from different ideologies. The only unifying figure of this coalition was Néstor Kirchner himself (Schurman, 2006). Thus, I have coded 1 for the first election and 2 for the rest in the category Personality Dependent.</p>
<p>Although she held no position in government, since Cristina was Néstor’s wife, a member of the Senate before her 2007 campaign and participated actively in her husband’s political decisions, she can be considered as belonging to the “inner-circle” of power before running in 2007. Therefore, I have coded her as a 3. Scioli’s campaign and personal position as Vice-president, although not identical, can be considered largely as a continuation of Cristina’s Kirchnerism and his campaign was read as such by the population (Smink, 2015).</p>

<section id="the-intransigent-party-and-frepaso" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-intransigent-party-and-frepaso">The Intransigent Party and FrePaSo</h2>
<p>The Intransigent Party was a branch of the Radical Civic Union and which obtained its best result in the legislative elections of 1985. As its foundational document states, their principles are “popular participation, economic nationalism, social justice and Latin American integration” (Intransigent Party, 1975: 30). They argued in favor of an anti-imperialist revolution that would transform capitalism and liberate the people (Intransigent Party, 1975: 37).</p>
<p>FrePaSo is a coalition of parties that included Peronists that were critic with Menem, Frente Grande, the Communist party, the Intransigent party and Christian democrats. The party obtained good results in 1995 in both the legislative and the presidential elections. Bordon’s rhetoric stressed the need for a “serious and responsible” political proposal based on the “work culture” and promised “honesty, austerity and capacity to recognize when I make a mistake” (Neustadt, 1995). The presidential candidate abandoned the party the following year. Koessl (2009) argues that FrePaSo’s success was due to the internal problems of the UCR, Menem’s neoliberal policies and the pact between these parties (“Pacto de Olivos”) which gave the impression that there was no political opposition to the bipartisan system. It is precisely this image as a political alternative what explains its success but the party’s rhetoric, particularly that of its leader, is difficult to classify as populist. Thus, I have not added the party in the list.</p>
