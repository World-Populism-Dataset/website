<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="álvaro-uribe">Álvaro Uribe</h2>
<p>Colombia has traditionally been conceived as an unfertile country for the emergence of populist forces (Dugas, 2003; Giraldo, 2018). Although Jorge Eliécer Gaitán and Gustavo Rojas Pinilla are considered examples of populism there is much debate on whether Álvaro Uribe Vélez, the most influential politician of the XXI Century in Colombia, can be classified as a populist or not. Uribe did not emphasize the opposition with the financial elites, was not particularly charismatic and rejected explicitly populism (Dugas, 2002: 1126). Uribe also defended orthodox and neoliberal policies because one of his main “three pillars”, “investment trust” was to make Colombia a secure and attractive place for foreign investment (Uribe, 2002). Moreover, Uribe was particularly known for his hard stance on security issues. The first of his three pillars was the “democratic security” which involved hardline policies regarding left-wing guerrillas such as the FARC.</p>
<p>However, none of these are sufficient reasons not to classify Uribe as a populist. Uribe had been a member of the Liberal Party but ran as an independent in the 2002 election under a platform called “Colombia First”. He strongly criticized the political system at the time, saying in his 100 points manifesto (2002: point 4) that “I dream with a state that serves the people and not corruption and politicking” (“politiquería”). This last term is a derogatory way to refer to politics and it is very present in Uribe’s campaign, so much that one of his promises was to announce a “Referendum against Corruption and Politicking” as his very first action in government (Uribe, 2002: point 9). In that same manifesto, he also criticized pluralism by stating that “pluralism had been transformed into dispersion and anarchy due to the salaries, the clientelism and the pension privileges” (Uribe, 2002: point 22). Furthermore, he made constant references to the fatherland and aimed to achieve national unity in the fight against the guerrillas. Uribe clearly delimitated an “us” vs “them” based on support to his security policies. He divided society between “the patriots that support the policy of Democratic Security and the Communists in disguise that wish to sell the fatherland to the FARC” (Fierro, 2012: 130). He conceded no legitimacy to the guerrillas and attacked those who did as traitors. The only legitimate policy was to defeat the armed groups in order to achieve a country “without guerrillas, without paramilitaries… without drugs” (Uribe 2002: points 26 and 31). Some of the policies involved “praising the profession of soldier and policemen” (Uribe 2002: point 28) as well as paying regular citizens that had undertaken anti-terrorist actions (Uribe 2002: point 39).</p>
<p>His manifesto clearly states the protection of minority rights and immigration is not a relevant element in his platform. As a former governor of one of Colombia’s regions and mayor to one of its most important cities, Uribe was included in previous political settlements but was a peripheral figure in them. Although he created the new party and undertook a very personalistic style, the decay of the previous political system was evident and anti-corruption was a common platform among several parties in the 2002 election (Duges, 2003: 1126). Uribe declared a state-of-siege shortly after becoming president which was condemned by human rights organizations (El País, 2002), has attacked the press (Fierro, 2014: 139) and has been repeatedly accused of collaboration with far-right paramilitary groups (El País, 2006).</p>
<p>However, the state-of-siege measure is quite common in Colombian history and he accepted the Constitutional Court’s decisions when they did not rule in his favor (Dugas, 2003: 1133). Therefore, I have classified him as 1 in Immigration and Ethnic Others and as 2 in Personality Dependent, Insider Populism and Violation of LD norms.</p>
<p>It is certainly difficult to classify Uribe into one category but there are enough elements in a world comparison, to include him in the database at this stage of the project.</p>
<p>Álvaro Uribe ended his presidency with one of the highest approval rates in Colombian history and his personality has profoundly marked politics after him. When he failed to pass a law that could allow him to run for a third time, Juan Manuel Santos was regarded as his successor. Santos had been Uribe’s Defense Minister and, although he ran a campaign that was also tough on the FARC, his profile was that of a rich technocrat that ran on a platform of continuity with Uribe’s politics. He argued that he was the opposite to populism and shortly after his victory he changed his discourse regarding the guerrillas. He initiated the “peace dialogues” with the FARC and that made Uribe distance from him. The most important expression of this conflict was the 2016 referendum on the Peace Agreement.</p>
<p>Santos’ main rival in 2014 and its successor in the presidency in 2018 have both been successors of Uribe under the umbrella of the Democratic Centre, the party that Uribe founded in 2013 to confront Santos. The CD is a party regarded my many as right-wing although they explicitly situate themselves in the center. Uribe’s ideas have remained fairly constant throughout the past 20 years and the CD shares his programmatic points view, merely adding two more to Uribe’s three pillars (CD website). I have coded this party in the same manner as the rest of Uribe’s government in all legislative elections.</p>
<p>However, the inclusion of the two presidential candidates of the Uribismo as populist is less clear. They both owe their popularity to being related to Uribe, they did not try to distance themselves from him and their discourses are less anti-elitists, more plural and more moderate than that of the leader of the CD. These politicians agree with Uribe on the substantive elements of his discourse but employ to a much lesser degree his populist strategies. Francisco Panizza (in private conversation) argued against including them in any populism dataset and Jorge Giraldo uses the label populist just to refer to the figure of Álvaro Uribe (Giraldo, 2019). I, too, agree that neither Óscar Zuluaga nor Iván Duque should be included. However, in case the team decides to include them, I have tried to find similarities in their discourse that may justify their inclusion.</p>
<p>In the 2014 presidential election, Óscar Iván Zuluaga’s motto was “on the side of the Colombians”. In a TV ad, Uribe reads a text in which defends Zuluaga’s candidacy in order “to vote against the Castro-Chavismo that some wish to bring to Colombia and that the government allows” (Zuluaga, 2014a). The election was dominated by the topic of the “peace process” in which Zuluaga (2018b) claimed he would stop the dialogues if he were to become president of Colombia. Zuluaga had been Minister of Finance with Uribe and did not make any claim against immigrants or ethnic minorities.</p>
<p>Iván Duque is difficult to classify as well. Constant references to the fatherland and Colombia and a clear opposition to the peace agreements situate him as a follower of Uribe´s politics. In his inaugural address he stated clearly his vision of popular unity when stating: “Let’s not let anything distract us from the path of union. No more divisions of left and right: we are Colombia; no more false divisions between neoliberals and socialists: we are Colombia; no more divisions between tendencies: we are Colombia” (Duque, 2018). Moreover, Duque tried to establish a direct connection with the people by stating over and over in one of his political adds “I am like you, proud of my country and willing to do anything for it” (Duque, 2018b). Duque was an unknown politician in 2018 which only had 4 years of experience as a senator. Previous to that he worked at international organizations in technical positions. His success depends mainly from being Álvaro Uribe´s chosen candidate. On immigration, Duque proposed the creation of a “humanitarian fund” for migrants from Venezuela that have fled the country (Tomaselli, 2018). Although Duque is included in the database for its belonging to the CD, its ties with Uribe and some aspects of his discourse, it should be noted that he displays a more moderated and plural understanding of politics than other members of his party (Tomaselli, 2018).</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="m-19">M-19</h2>
<p>The party “Alternative Democracy M-19”, came out of a peace process between the government of Colombia and several left-wing guerrillas such as M-19. As part of these peace accords, a new constitution was drafted in 1991 and the guerrillas were included in the political process. The main ideology of the party was Marxist (Boudon, 2001: 75) but the party aimed at reaching a larger section of the electorate by presenting themselves as “the new political alternative” and “more than a party” (Villamizar, 1995: 571). The central issue for the party, however, was not communism, but democracy (Boudon, 2001: 76). Carlos Pizarro, leader of the M-19 until his assassination, employed populist tropes when he argued that “what we need to do is create something that attracts the nonconformists within the traditional parties, the nonconformists within the private enterprise, the nonconformists within the guerrilla ranks, the nonconformists within society in general… and which it is capable of offering proposals to the nation” (quoted in Beccassino, 1989: 110). The M-19 also heavily criticized Liberal President Gaviria’s neoliberal reforms and the hardline it took with the existing active guerrilla groups (Boudon, 2001: 81).</p>
<p>Their platform was based on 8 points: “(1) peace and an end to violence, (2) rejection of corruption and clientelism, (3) constitutional development toward a”social state of law”, (4) an economic policy based on production and an expanding socioeconomic base, (5) a specific employment program, (6) a pact to protect the environment, (7) priority for social programs, and (8) Latin American regional integration” (El Nuevo Siglo, 1993). Moreover, the party emphasized the need to end military impunity (Boudon, 2001: 89). They do not mention immigration or ethnic others as threats and the party did not take any action against the prevailing LD norms. Navarro Wolf, the presidential candidate, did briefly participate in Pastrana’s government as Health Minister but this was seen more as a political concession in the context of the peace process. Navarro Wolf belonged to the inner circle of decision making. Therefore, I have coded FL for ideology, 3 for Political Class, Financial Elite, Military and Foreign Interests and 1 for every other category.</p>

<section id="gustavo-petro" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="gustavo-petro">Gustavo Petro</h2>
<p>The 2018 elections saw the emergence of a left-wing populist candidate, Gustavo Petro. Petro was part of the M-19 guerrilla and later of the party of the same name. When the party disbanded, he became part of the left-wing party “Polo Democrático” achieving the ranks of MP, Senator and presidential candidate in 2010. Petro later founded his own party, “Movimiento Progesista” and became mayor of Bogotá. He then run for president of Colombia in 2018 under the platform “Humane Colombia” (“Colombia Humana”). Since he never took part in any national government or belonged to any of the most popular parties, I have labelled 1 for Insider Populism. Gustavo Petro created the new party and the presidential coalition and ran on a populist platform based on his personal figure. None of these may have existed without the candidate himself although probably a left-wing variety of populism would have emerged in its place. Therefore, I have coded 2 for Personality Dependent.</p>
<p>In a TV advertisement, Petro clearly outlined his populist discourse: “The first time that a presidential candidate that does not represent the”politiquería”, not the power of the elites, nor the corrupts who have sacked the country and are now surrounding Duque, may win the elections” and “it is the first time that a government may be formed that really works for the people” (Petro, 2018a).</p>
<p>Corruption is the main topic of his discourse and he relates all of Colombia’s problems to it. For example, he states that “the problem with the healthcare system is not that we need more money, but corruption” (Petro, 2018b). He also dilutes its ideological position when he defends that “I was leftist and I do not regret it but my proposal is not socialist, that did not work, we propose the development of a democratic capitalism based on granting access to a rural middle class to productive lands” (Petro, 2018b). However, Petro is very critic with the huge inequalities of the country and aims to distribute wealth extensively. I believe the best way to code Petro is with Left for Ideology, 3 for Political Class and 2 for Financial Elite.</p>
<p>Petro’s opinion on the army was dominated by a comment he made in the campaign in which he said that “those youngsters that cannot study in university may end … in the drug cartels or trying to find a job in the police or the army” (Petro, 2018c). Petro (2018d) rejected the notion that he hated the military and defended himself by saying that he gave shelter to the army while mayor of Bogotá. I have decided to follow Petro’s own self-description and label him as 1 in military.</p>
<p>I have found no significant action in violation of LD norms. In the campaign, Petro criticized that the Colombian foreign policy was subordinated to that of the US due to the money this country provides to Colombia to fight drug cartels (Petro, 2018e). He also argued for Colombia to occupy a more prominent and less subordinate role in international politics. During the crisis in Venezuela, Petro called for rallies against any military intervention in Venezuela by the US (Petro, 2019). Although Petro is clearly critic of foreign power interests, these are not constructed as the main threat to the country. I have labelled 2 in Foreign Interests.</p>
