## One Nation Party

One Nation Party (ONP), led and created by Queensland Senator Pauline
Hanson, has been Australia's most recognisable populist party in recent
decades. Hanson was once a Liberal Party candidate in outer-suburban
Brisbane in the 1996 election, before the party disendorsed her due to
past comments about indigenous Australians (Mason 2010, 186). She went
on to stand and win as an independent. As a Member of Parliament she
provoked enormous media attention through controversial nativist and
xenophobic rhetoric. She founded ONP after winning, which enjoyed some
success in the next 1998 election (despite Hanson losing her own seat)
before collapsing under the pressures of internal and legal fights that
ended up sending her to prison (Rutherford 2001). Under the new name
Pauline Hanson's One Nation it made a surprising comeback in the 2016
elections, but did not pass the 5% threshold in the lower house
(although it did better in the Senate, where Hanson won a seat).

Hanson became an immediate sensation when she declared in her maidan
speech in Parliament that Australia was in danger of being "swamped by
Asians" (Mughan and Paxton 2006, 344). This was indicative of a range of
her other xenophobic attacks on Asians (Ahluwalia and McCarthy 1998,
83), whom she claimed were responsible for drugs and crime (Stokes 2000,
28). More generally she classed immigrants from the "Third World" as a
threat to Australian culture due to their refusal to assimilate into it
(Reynolds 2000, 28; Mughan and Paxton 2006, 344; Deutchman and Ellison
1999, 36). In doing so she appealed to anti-immigrant attitudes in the
community that major parties were less willing (at the time) to stoke
(Goot and Watson 2001). She also made numerous statements critical of
Indigenous Australians (Melleuish 1997; Deutchman 2000, 51; DeAngelis
2003, 86), claiming that a "reverse racism" policy was unfairly
advantaging them in them via more generous welfare policies at the
expense of others (Johnson 1998). All of this established her solid
OTH_ETHNIC and OTH_IMMIGRANT foundations (both = 3).

From its inception, the party sought to label as out of touch the
political elite in the major parties (Labor and the Liberal/National
coalition), and dissatisfaction with the functioning of the political
system has always been a core part of ONP appeal (Reynolds 2000, 165;
DeAngelis 2003, 86).

Hanson made general claims against "politicians" in a catch all way
(Deutchman and Ellison 1999, 37), and cultivated an image as an
"anti-politician, untarnished by not being a member of the generally
despised political establishment" (Pasquarelli 1997, 6). Hanson claimed
policies targeting and excluding white non-Indigenous Austrailans were
bound with the fundamental elitism of the political system writ large.
She claiming that the establishment had lost touch with the mainstream
opinion and experience on race and immigration (Jackman 1998, 170), was
forcing multi-culturalism on ordinary Australians against their will
(Stokes 2000, 27), and pushed a repressive "political correctness"
agenda to silence ordinary people (Ahluwalia and McCarthy 1998). This
system, she claimed, resulted in a net benefit for the elites -- which
she termed the "New Class" (Melleuish 1997, 25) -- at the expense of
ordinary people. In one notable example of this narrative, Hanson
claimed that:

> In response to my call for equality for all Australians, the most
> noisy criticism came from the fat cats, bureaucrats and the
> do-gooders. They screamed the loudest because they stand to lose the
> most -- their power, money and position, all funded by ordinary
> Australian taxpayers (Jackman 1998, 168).

In opposition to this elite, Hanson sold her credentials as someone in
touch with "the people", owing to her humble outer suburban origins and
her time running a fish and chip shop (Moffit 2017, 124; Deutchman 2000,
36; Nile 1997, 1). Due to this rhetoric we've coded ONP as 3 on
OTH_POLCLASS.

Banks and big businesses were among the New Class elite in her discourse
(Stokes 2000, 30). Specifically, she accused Australian companies of
selling out to foreign stockholders (Louw and Loo 1997, 6) at the
expense of the national interest. Given that this was a relatively
smaller "other" to the people, we've coded ONP as 2 on OTH_ECONOMIC.
Despite being opposed to foreign immigrants, we've seen no evidence that
Hanson accused foreign powers or entities of controlling Australian
politics at the expense of the people (OTH_FOREIGN = 1).

Despite generally maintaining a state interventionist and protectionist
set of economic policies (DeAngelis 2003, 86), Hanson's cultural and
immigration policies are by far the more salient part of her politics,
and for that she has been consistently labelled "radical right" in the
secondary literature (Moffit 2017, 124; Deutchman and Ellison 1999, 34)
(LRPOSITION = FR). ONP has always been a personalist operation (Moffit
2017, 125), totally dependent on Hanson\'s "charismatic" personality
(DeAngelis 2003, 87; Mason 2010) and her capacity to attract media
attention (Louw and Loo 1997; Deutchman and Ellison 1999, 35; Lewis
1997). Internally, Hanson and her close associates maintained total
control of the party structure -- one of the reasons why the party
collapsed was its lack of internal democracy and Hanson's autocratic
leadership style (Rutherford 2001, 193). This has led ONP to be called
the "One Person Party (Nile 1997) (CHARISMA = 3). Despite her attaches
on social liberal norms, we've seen no evidence that Hanson or ONP
threatened the liberal democratic system in Australia (LIBDEMNORMS = 1),
and as she has never been part of any government, we've coded her 1 on
INSIDER.

## Palmer's United Party, Clive Palmer

Clive Palmer is a billionaire mining magnate who split from the
Liberal-National Party (LNP) (of which he was once a financier) in 2012,
allegedly after being denied a government contract to build a railway
line. He stood in the 2013 election with his own party, Palmer\'s United
Party (PUP) (Kefford and McDonnell 2018, 384). With an enormous
advertising budget, PUP won 5.49% of the national lower house vote and
one seat (taken by him) in the Parliament. Following the departure of
several PUP senators after the election and Palmer's extra-parliamentary
business scandals, the project was put on hiatus in the subsequent 2016
election, only to return as the United Australia Party in 2019. In its
comeback it only managed 3.43% of the lower house vote, due to which we
have only included it in the dataset in 2013.

The central message of the PUP was its distain for the Australia's two
major parties (Moffit 2017, 125; Kefford and McDonnell 2016, 192). It
claimed that these major parties (the Labor party and the LNP) were not
only out of touch, but actively hostile to the interests of ordinary
people. For example, Palmer accused LNP leader Tony Abbott of trying to
"sell off Australia to people only concerned with making money. Whatever
they pay, they will only do it so they can charge you more" (Kefford and
McDonnell 2016, 185). PUP did not differentiate between the two parties,
considering them part of the single corrupt system. In opposition to
this system, he styled himself as an "anti-politician" (Watson 2014,
27), in touch with the concerns of ordinary Australians (OTH_POLCLASS =
3).

Aside from the political class, Palmer's populism didn't target very
many "others" to the ordinary people. Although there is a nationalist
steak to his politics, his OTH_FOREIGN rhetoric only picked up in his
2019 reincarnation (= 1 in 2013). Unlike Hanson, Palmer's populism did
not (during the 2013 campaign at least) target ethnic others or
immigrants (Moffit 2017, 125; Watson 2014, 2)(OTH_IMMIGRANT = 1,
OTH_ETHNIC = 1). In fact the party actually favoured increasing support
to refugees and was generally more progressive on immigration than the
major parties (Kefford and McDonnell 2016, 185; Moffit 2017, 133). As a
major industrialist and billionaire, he never engaged in any consistent
rhetoric against major financial interests or businesses (OTH_ECONOMIC =
1), nor against the military (OTHMILITARY =1).

As its name suggests, it has been seen as little more than a vehicle for
Palmer\'s personal brand and ambition (Kefford and McDonnell 2016, 187).
As a candidate he commanded a flamboyant, unpredictable personal image
(Moffit 2017, 125; Watson 2014, 27), and a used a highly combative
interview style. Structurally, the party was almost entirely funded by
Palmer, and totally controlled by him (Kefford and McDonnell 2018,
385--89). For this reason PUP has been considered a "personal party"
built around Palmer that would not exist without him (Kefford and
McDonnell 2018, 388) (CHARISMA = 3). Palmer's policies in the 2013
election were an "eclectic" (Moffit 2017, 125) mix of crowd-pleasing
contradictions (Kefford and McDonnell 2016, 184), including higher
spending, lower taxes and the elimination of the national debt, and as a
result Kefford and McDonnell claim that the party's ideology "cannot be
easily classified" (Kefford and McDonnell 2016, 183). There may be an
argument that the vague nationalism of the party makes it right-leaning,
but we've coded it C on LRPOSITION due to its ideological ambiguity and
vagueness. While Palmer was a high-profile donor to the LNP party before
leaving it (Kefford and McDonnell 2018, 384), it is not evident that he
was any kind of "insider" to previous governments in the way that we are
using term (INSIDER = 1), and while he consistently attacked critics in
the media with great vitriol (Moffit 2017, 125), there is nothing in his
campaigning conduct that challenges liberal democratic norms as we've
defined them (LIBDEMNORMS = 1).
