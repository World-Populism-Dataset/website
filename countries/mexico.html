<p>Mexico has been dominated for most of the 20th Century by one party, the “Partido Revolucionario Institucional” or PRI. The PRI governed Mexico from 1930 until 2000 and, although other parties were legalized, participated in elections and obtained some seats, victory over the PRI was virtually impossible due to the corruption of the electoral system. It was not until the electoral reforms of the 1990s were implemented, that Vicente Fox, from the PAN, was able to become the president in 2000. Thus, electoral results before the year 2000 should be taken with caution since elections were not fully democratic. Elections to the Senate coincide with the presidential elections since 2003, thus, there are no elections to the Upper House in the legislative midterms since 2003.</p>
<section id="cuauhtémoc-cárdenas-prd" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cuauhtémoc-cárdenas-prd">Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas / PRD</h2>
<p>One of the most famous leaders of el PRI was Lázaro Cárdenas, which is considered the prototype of populist leader in Mexico. His son, Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas, was a member of the PRI but left it criticizing that the party had lost its revolutionary origins and initiated a movement within the PRI called “Corriente Democrática”. Rejection by PRI leadership of this current’s claims to democratize the party led to the expelling of Cárdenas and encouraged him to run in the 1988 presidential election against the PRI with a populist platform. Basurto (1999: 95) argues that Cuauhtémoc “resurrected the ideology of his father, based on the so-called revolutionary nationalism and on populist mobilization of the masses”. The internal document of the “Corriente Democrática” (1988: 40) already contains most of Cárdenas later ideas and argues for the validity of the principles of the Mexican Revolution and for the “reconquering of the independence and dignity of the people”. They stated that their fight was for “for the rescue of the full meaning of citizenship, for social equality, for the productive economy, for natural resources, for cultural identity and for the high moral hierarchy of the nation” (Corriente Democrática, 1988: 40). Neo-Cardenistas, as Basurto (1999: 84) calls them, strongly opposed neoliberalism and their economic nationalism fueled a double criticism against financial elites and foreign interests. Cuauhtémoc (1987: 307) argued that “behind the sources of credit stand vested political and economic interests that, in addition to mere financial profits, sought to transform a commercial relationship into one of political dependency. Negotiations concerning our debt are dominated by our imperialistic neighbor, whose government has been dangerously aggressive”. Thus, I have coded 3 in both Financial Elites and in Foreign Interests.</p>
<p>Cuauhtémoc ran under the coalition “National Democratic Front” in 1998, which was supported by the Popular Socialist Party, the Authentic Party of the Mexican Revolution, among others. He then founded the “Party of the Democratic Revolution” (or PRD) in 1989, which assumed most of the ideas of the National Democratic Front and the “Corriente Democrática”.</p>
<p>Another of the main tropes in Cárdenas’ rhetoric is the renovation of Mexican politics, due to the corruption of the parties. “Corriente Democrática” argued for the implementation of primaries inside the PRI and the PRD defended the full democratization of the country (Basurto, 1999: 87). Although the PRD shared objectives with the Zapatistas, they rejected their military approach (Basurto, 1999: 91). Therefore, I have coded 1 in Violation of LD norms since the PRD argues strongly for a deeper democratization of Mexico. Before leaving the PRI, Cárdenas had been part of the government, member of the senate and governor of a province. Thus, although he was not in the inner circle of decision making, he was a well-established figure in the previous regime. I have coded 2 for Inner Populism.</p>
<p>The Mexican army was seen by important sectors of the left as part of the establishment, particularly since the massacre of Tlatelolco in 1968. However, as the son of a general, Cuauhtémoc was less aggressive towards the military that other leftists and valued its function as the guarantor of national sovereignty. Its position was that an investigation needed to happen on the events of 1968 but that the military as a whole could not be blamed for it (Cárdenas, 1998). Thus, I have coded 1 for Military. Although Cuauhtémoc’s personal history and his initiative in splitting from the PRI are essential to understand the PRD, the fact that it was born out of a previous movement inside the party points that Cárdenas acted more as the catalyzer than as the creator of the movement. I have coded 1 in Personality Dependent. There is no negative mention of immigrants or ethnic others in the PRD’s discourse.</p>
<p>In 2018, the PRD becomes part of a cross-party presidential coalition lead by the PAN, which greatly dilutes their former populist stance. I have not included the PRD in the 2018 election.</p>

<section id="andrés-manuel-lópez-obrador" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="andrés-manuel-lópez-obrador">Andrés Manuel López Obrador</h2>
<p>Under Cárdenas’ leadership, the PRD participated in all elections running on a similar platform. In the 2006 presidential elections, the party presented Andrés Manuel López Obrador (commonly known as AMLO) as the presidential candidate. AMLO followed Cárdenas when he left the PRI, unsuccessfully tried to become governor of the province of Tabasco with the PRD in the 1990s, became the president of the PRD in 1996 and achieved the position of governor of the Federal District from 2000 until 2005. Although he occupied important positions in Mexican politics, he did not belong to the inner circle of PRI’s decision making and, for that reason, I have coded 1 in Insider Populism. AMLO was very popular in the polls (Álvarez Béjar, 2006: 27) and his political campaign was in large part based on his figure (Espinoza and Navarrete, 2016: 94). Moreover, he had important differences with his party such as running on a political platform more moderate (Bruhn, 2012: 91) and strongly criticizing its former leader (Cruz González, 2006). Therefore, given his efforts to distinguish itself from a party and his popularity, I have coded 2 in Personality Dependent.</p>
<p>According to Bruhn (2012) AMLO’s platform in 2006 had two souls. On the one side, AMLO refrained from employing a Manichean distinction between people and elites on speeches with the mass media and in television ads (Bruhn, 2012: 91-92). Moreover, his economic proposals were quite moderate and “substantially to the right of his own party’s platform” (Bruhn, 2012: 91). The party and AMLO self-identified as left-wing and that was how the electorate perceived the party, but it should be noted that López Obrador toned down this position during his campaign. On the other side, however, AMLO employed a strong populist discourse in campaign rallies and speeches in plazas and other public spaces. Bruhn (2012: 92) has analyzed quantitatively AMLO’s discourses and finds that references to a morally superior people and blaming of a corrupt elite are extremely common in his rallies. AMLO stated, for example, that “what we have to do therefore is unite the people, this is the struggle of the whole people of Mexico to defend its interests, against a band that has perpetuated itself in power and has carried our country to ruin, that’s how clear things are” (López Obrador 2006a) and that “those at the very top do not want to let go of power ... they cannot be satisfied, they want to continue devouring the country, but enough already, now it’s the people’s turn; it is time now for the people to govern our country, for the people to benefit” (López Obrador 2006b).</p>
<p>The distinction between elites and masses is mainly based on political terms. The long dominance of the PRI facilitated the distinction between “the corrupt and outdated institutions that have the people oppressed” (López Obrador, 2005). Institutional corruption is the basis of his campaign although he is also committed to social equality, being one of his most important mottos: “for the good of all, the poor first”. Moreover, his discourse towards the PAN was based on equating the PAN with the policies and attitudes of the PRI (Bruhn, 2012: 93). Lastly, although it is not one of the main axes of his discourse, AMLO has criticized several times the existing NAFTA agreement as detrimental for Mexico and in need for improvement (Cattan and McKee, 2018). Therefore, I have coded Left for ideology, 3 for Political Class, 2 for Foreign Interest and 2 for Financial Elites.</p>
<p>In 2006 AMLO argued for the need to “give more power to the military in all issues related to the fight against the drug cartels and organized crimes” (López Obrador, 2006c), he has also reiterated constantly his support to the Mexican indigenous peoples and does not have a negative view of immigrants.</p>
<p>AMLO lost the 2006 election by a very small margin. López Obrador did not accept the result, called into question the electoral system and even declared himself as the legitimate president of Mexico. The courts denied a recount of the votes and AMLO called for protests and blocked important streets in Mexico and the US Embassy. According to Bruhn (2012: 98) AMLO’s attempt to create a constitutional crisis shows that his commitment to liberal democratic institutions was very shallow. The constitutional crisis did not succeed because AMLO misjudged the level of support from the population. Nonetheless, this experience radicalized his discourse and made AMLO emphasize his populist discourse. As an example of his discourse, in 2007, he wrote a book titled: “The Mafia Stole the Presidency from US”. Even if it happened after the election, I have coded 3 in violation of LD norms in the 2006 election given the time closeness. In fact, this was not the first time he denounced corrupt elections. In his unsuccessful campaigns in the 1990s to become governor of Tabasco he also complained of electoral fraud and in his more recent position as president he is concentrating enormous power in his figure. Moreover, he also rejected calling Enrique Peña Nieto the legitimate president of Mexico, although he won the 2012 elections. Therefore, AMLO’s shallow commitment to LD norms does not seem to be restricted to a specific moment.</p>
<p>AMLO run his 2012 and 2018 campaigns under a similar platform to that of 2006, which emphasizes institutional corruption as the main trope of his populist discourse but putting forward center-left policies. After the defeat in 2012, AMLO created his own new party, the “Movement for National Regeneration” or MORENA, as it is popularly called. This party participated in the 2015 midterms and in the 2018 legislative elections and constituted the main party of the presidential coalition with which AMLO obtained the presidency in 2018. The party, as López Obrador’s personal platform, is based entirely on AMLO’s discourse and persona (Espinoza and Navarrete, 2016: 97). That is why I have labelled 3 for Personality Dependent.</p>

<section id="satellite-parties" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="satellite-parties">Satellite parties</h2>
<p>The Party of the Cardenist Front of National Reconstruction, the Popular Socialist Party and the Authentic Party of the Mexican Revolution fit well within the category of satellite or subordinate parties as defined by Sartori (1976) (Rueda, 1998; López, 2001). In the context of a hegemonic party system, the hegemonic party allows the existence of other parties that have limited freedom and that, ultimately, respond to the interests of the main party. In this sense, their support for the presidential campaign of Cuauhtémoc in 1988 constitutes more an exception than the rule of action of these parties. All three rejected being included in the PRD and sidelined again with the PRI in the 90’s. They lack a strong populist discourse because they are part of the system and thus, they cannot be considered populist parties. Therefore, I have not included those parties in the database. This means that in 1988, only the presidential elections are counted as having a populist option: Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas.</p>
