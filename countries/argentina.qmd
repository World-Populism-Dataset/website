## Carlos Menem

Argentina suffered a coup by the military that overthrew the Peronist
government of Isabel Perón and imposed a military dictatorship. The
first free elections after the coup took place in 1983 and Raul Alfonsín
became president until 1989, when he was succeeded by Carlos Menem.
Carlos Menem is a complicated figure. Most authors agree that he won the
1989 election running a campaign based on the traditional Peronist
discourse articulated around the concepts of "salariazo" and "the
revolution of production" (Burdman, 2008: 10). In this victory speech,
for instance, Menem proclaimed his was the victory of the "heroic march
of national unity to be protagonist of a historic battle that all
Argentinians must undertake \... against privileges, against vested
interests, against speculators and usurers, against those who seek that
nothing changes so that misery, underdevelopment, poverty and hunger
continue in the Argentinian Republic" (Menem, 1989b). He also proclaimed
that "my only compromise is to achieve the happiness of the Argentinian
people and the greatness of the fatherland" (Menem, 1989b). Hawkins and
Rovira Kaltwasser (2017) argue that his 1989 campaign indeed showed
signs of a Manichean division between the elite and the people.

Fair (2011: 2) argues that Menem initiated a timid dialogue with the
military, stressed the need for peace and hinted that he would
[indult]{.mark} the military, as he later did. Menem stressed his
commitment to democracy by arguing that they, as opposed to the radical
party, were the only ones holding primary elections in their party
(Menem, 1989a). Burdam (2008: 13) argues that although Menem stressed
the need to achieve economic independence this did not meant, as it did
with Perón, freedom from the dependence vis-à-vis the UK, but simply the
modernization of the economy and the level of production, without
addressing who owns the capital. Therefore, I have coded 1 for military,
LD norms violation and Foreign Interests.

However, Menem quickly shifted his economic discourse and embraced
neoliberal policies devoted to control inflation. This fact has sparked
the debate on Menem's populism. For those authors who defend a more
substantive definition of populism (Hawkins and Rovira Kaltwasser, 2017;
Levitsky, 2003) Menem should not be considered populist after 1989.
Neoliberal policies are considered to be opposed to neoliberalism and
Menem is portrayed as betraying its previous populist stance. Moreover,
Hawkins and Rovira Kaltwasser (2017) find little Manichean discourse
between the elite and the people in his 1995 campaign. For authors that
define populism based on personalism, a direct connection with the
people, concentration of power and transgressing liberal political norms
(Weyland, 2003: 6, 1996; Wehner, 2004) and less on substantive elements,
neoliberalism and populism have a number of synergies. These include low
levels of institutionalization, targeting unorganized poor, distancing
themselves from unions, professional organizations and business groups
and the use of the state to push through reform against opposition
(Weyland, 2003: 2-3). Menem presented itself as a courageous leader that
attacked the crisis head-on and thus deliver the country from
hyperinflation demonstrating and reinforced his charisma (Weyland, 2003:
4). This author argues that "when the country confronted a deep open
crisis and neoliberals prescribed the shock therapy of drastic market
reform, they relied on the boldness and transgressive tendencies of
neo-populist leaders to carry out this plan of action" (Weyland 2003:
5). Moreover, it was this boldness in the initial crisis what may
explain their downfall as inflation lost importance compared to
unemployment and growth, areas where neoliberal policies fare less well
(Weyland 2003; Wehner, 2004). This understanding of the connection of
neoliberalism and neo-populism is not very far from Hall's and Jacques's
(1983) understanding of the politics of Thatcher.

Wehner (2004: 41) attributes Menem's 1995 reelection to the relatively
good results of his neoliberal economic policies. High inflation had
been huge problem during Alfonsín's government and, although poverty and
employment did not improve, Menem's ability to control inflation was
rewarded by the Argentinian voters (Wehner, 2004: 46). In government, he
had proclaimed an amnesty to militaries involved in the dictatorship and
promoted close relationships with the EEUU in what was known as
"relaciones carnales" through, for example, participating in the
invasion to Kuwait (Botta, 2012: 157).

I have coded Menem in 1989. However, I have finally ruled against
including him the rest of his years in government due to its lack of
Manichean distinction between elite and people and his more pluralist
understanding of politics.

## Néstor Kirchner

In 2001, Argentina suffered a very strong economic and political crisis
provoked by the "corralito" (which severely restricted people\'s ability
to withdraw cash from banks). Widespread anger against the political
system was summed in the motto \"All of them must go!\" ("¡Que se vayan
todos!"). The election of Néstor Kirchner in 2003 as president of
Argentina can be seen as the political outcome of that crisis. Néstor
ran a campaign based on an opposition to the "old political class" and
the "Fatherland's enemies" (Padoan, 2017: 533; Fernández, 2010: 205). He
argued for a radical change in the political system, the retrieval of
the traditional Peronists goals of "Economic Independency", "Political
Sovereignty" and "Social Justice" (Padoan, 2017: 533) and criticized the
Peronists of the 1990s for not delivering their promises and betraying
Perón (Kirchner, 2003). Néstor condemned harshly the human rights abuses
of the military dictatorship and the presidents before him for not
prosecuting their crimes. Thus, once in government, he revoked the "Law
of Due Obedience" and the "Full Stop law" and renewed the military
hierarchy because the previous one was seen as part of the establishment
(Fernández, 2010: 202). I have coded 3 for political class and for
military.

Economically, Néstor argued forcefully against the neoliberal reforms
that Menem had implemented in the previous decade. Kirchner proclaimed
the need to rethink the economic system and, in his investment speech,
talked about constructing a "National capitalism" (Kirchner, 2003b;
Padoan, 2017: 533). The central issue in his economic and international
policies was the payment of Argentina's debt. Argentina had accrued a
huge debt problem and Néstor's solution consisted mainly on
restructuring it. He famously proclaimed that "the creditors have to
understand that they will only get paid if Argentina performs well"
(Kirchner, 2003b; Fernández, 2010: 206). He managed to restructure 76%
of the debt in 2005 and then Cristina did it again in 2010 up to 92%
(Fernández de Kirchner, 2014). The main construction of a foreign enemy
was done precisely on this point. Kirchnerism focuses less on attacks on
specific foreign others but calls into question the whole international
economic system that promotes neoliberal policies. Therefore, their
attacks are mainly directed towards international economic institutions
such as the IMF and against the financial elite (both national and
international) who is blamed for pressuring in favor of policies that
damage "the people" (Fernández, 2010). In Cristina's presidency this
opposition to foreign intervention was exemplified by the conflict over
US judge Thomas Griesa' decision over the payment of the debt to
creditors.

There is no important ethnic other for Kirchnerism and immigrants have
not been identified as the enemy of the people. In fact, Cristina has
had a welcoming stance towards immigration (Irigaray, 2014). In order to
underlie that their opposition to foreign interest are intrinsically
connected with their economic position and not with specific enemy
countries, I have marked a 3 for Financial and Foreign Interests, 1 for
Immigration and Ethnic Other and "left-wing" as political ideology.

Néstor Kirchner was an unknown governor of a province when, in 2003, he
launched his campaign (code 1 for insider populism in 2003). He was
endorsed by exiting president Eduardo Duhalde, in a move to stop Carlos
Menem from winning. He started with a 6% share in the polls and ended
with a 22%. Thus, the social demand for a left-wing protest party
produced by the devastating effects of the "corralito" may explain
better Kirchner's success than his charisma. However, the personality
cult around Kirchner should not be discarded and "kirchnerism" became
the name for the specific branch of populism developed by Néstor and
Cristina. Moreover, Kirchner won the election with a party coalition
(Front for Victory) and later constructed its party support not just
from the traditional Justicialist Party, but from a very diverse mix of
groups, governors and people from different ideologies. The only
unifying figure of this coalition was Néstor Kirchner himself (Schurman,
2006). Thus, I have coded 1 for the first election and 2 for the rest in
the category Personality Dependent.

Although she held no position in government, since Cristina was Néstor's
wife, a member of the Senate before her 2007 campaign and participated
actively in her husband's political decisions, she can be considered as
belonging to the "inner-circle" of power before running in 2007.
Therefore, I have coded her as a 3. Scioli's campaign and personal
position as Vice-president, although not identical, can be considered
largely as a continuation of Cristina's Kirchnerism and his campaign was
read as such by the population (Smink, 2015).

## The Intransigent Party and FrePaSo

The Intransigent Party was a branch of the Radical Civic Union and which
obtained its best result in the legislative elections of 1985. As its
foundational document states, their principles are "popular
participation, economic nationalism, social justice and Latin American
integration" (Intransigent Party, 1975: 30). They argued in favor of an
anti-imperialist revolution that would transform capitalism and liberate
the people (Intransigent Party, 1975: 37).

FrePaSo is a coalition of parties that included Peronists that were
critic with Menem, Frente Grande, the Communist party, the Intransigent
party and Christian democrats. The party obtained good results in 1995
in both the legislative and the presidential elections. Bordon's
rhetoric stressed the need for a "serious and responsible" political
proposal based on the "work culture" and promised "honesty, austerity
and capacity to recognize when I make a mistake" (Neustadt, 1995). The
presidential candidate abandoned the party the following year. Koessl
(2009) argues that FrePaSo's success was due to the internal problems of
the UCR, Menem's neoliberal policies and the pact between these parties
("Pacto de Olivos") which gave the impression that there was no
political opposition to the bipartisan system. It is precisely this
image as a political alternative what explains its success but the
party's rhetoric, particularly that of its leader, is difficult to
classify as populist. Thus, I have not added the party in the list.
