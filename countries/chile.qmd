-   Not included:

Chile suffered a military dictatorship at the hands of General Augusto
Pinochet from 1973 until 1990. In 1988 a referendum was held on whether
to continue with Pinochet's dictatorship, which was won by the NO. The
first democratic elections were held in 1989 and Patrio Aylwin, a
center-left Christian Democrat, became president. Chile has
traditionally been considered an exception to the succession of populist
leaders in other Latin American countries. As Drake (1999: 72) argues,
"populism did not disrupt the transition to democracy or occupy center
stage". "Centrist and leftist politicians did not want populism to upset
the new democracy any more than they wanted to disturb macroeconomic
equilibrium" (Drake, 1999: 72). Thus, none of the big coalition of
Chilean parties is considered populist by most scholars. However,
although no populist leader has held the presidency since 1990, there
are a number of less successful candidates that should be included in
that category.

## Francisco Javier Errázuriz

Along with the candidates of the right and left, Francisco Javier
Errázuriz, a wealthy businessman that came from a highly influential
family in Chile, claimed to represent the "centre-centre" of politics
(Drake, 1999: 73). Before running for president, Errázuriz held no
political position (1 in Insider Populism). The movement was a surprise
at the time and, not being backed by any party, his campaign was purely
based on his personal figure (3 in Personality Dependent).

Errázuriz appealed an antiparty undercurrent based on "vaguely
nationalistic, reformist, anticorruption, antipolitician platform aimed
at broad segments of the middle classes and unorganized workers" (Drake,
1999: 73). His platform was based on praising the free-market system and
promising social justice (Drake, 1999: 73). He put himself, a wealthy
businessman, as an example of an accomplished life and claimed to be
able to show Chileans the way to the same wealth and wellbeing
(Errázuriz, 1989a). I have labelled 3 for Political Class, and 1 for
Foreign Interests and Economical Elite.

Errázuriz's discourse, although anti-politician, was conciliatory. He
argued against the polarization of society in two blocks: "do not divide
the country in two sides... we need unity" (Errázuriz, 1989a) and he
claimed that he did not call voters to vote against nobody (Errázuriz,
1989b). Although he has been later involved in several cases of
corruption, there is nothing in his 1989 campaign that indicates a
violation of LD norms. However, his aim to leave the past behind also
means that he did not condemn the military dictatorship, nor it consider
it part of the establishment (1 in Military). I have not been able to
find any negative reference to either immigrants or Ethnic others.

## Joaquín Lavín

The Independent Democratic Union or (UDI) was founded in 1982 as one of
the parties that defended the military dictatorship. The party was
"inspired by Spanish Franquismo corporatism" and "its founding leader,
Jaime Guzmán, was the political ideologue of the authoritarian regime"
(Luna et al. 2013: 923). The UDI "was born in the midst of
neo-conservatism, and in the context of a conservative turn within the
Catholic Church" (Luna et al. 2013: 929). Moreover, the party "developed
close ties with business interests which partially explains its
electoral performance since 1989 in the upper sectors of the Chilean
society and its financial campaign advantages" (Luna et al. 2013: 924)
but also aimed at attracting the poorer sections of society through the
financing of specific programs targeted to the poor (Luna, 2010: 326).
As a defender of the military establishment and Pinochet's legacy, the
party cannot be considered populist in its first elections. Scholars
agree that it is Joaquin Lavin's leadership which introduces an
"anti-politics discourse" in the campaigns (Silva, 2001; Luna, 2010;
Luna et al. 2013; Cortés and Pelfini, 2017).

Joaquin Lavin's professional evolution follows that of other Chicago
boys-technocrats. He studied at Chicago, became dean of School of
Economics at a Chilean University, participated in Pinochet's
administration, became secretary general of the UDI from 1990 to 1994
and acted as mayor of a municipality in the 90s. He did not, however,
participate in the inner circle of Pinochet's government (1 for Insider
Populism). The UDI was very much attached to Pinochet's legacy but his
arrest in London in 1988 introduced a change in the political discourse
of the party, by which the praises to the dictatorship were kept to a
minimum (Silva, 2001: 28) and a more moderated image for the party was
crafted (Luna, 2010: 346). The crisis and several cases of corruption in
the previous government gave way to Lavin's anti-political and
neo-populist strategy "expressed in his abhorrence of politics and
political parties, and his inclination to \'technify\' social problems
and their solutions" (Silva, 2001: 33). He claimed to be concentrating
on the real problems of the people by addressing particular issues
instead crafting large plans. His is a combination of technocratic and
populist rhetoric (Silva, 2001: 33). The party self-proclaimed itself as
the "popular party" in order to enhance its identification with the
people and it proclaimed to overcome the left-right divide (Cortés and
Pelfini, 2017: 67). I have coded 3 for Political Class, 1 for Financial
Elite and Foreign Interests, given its strictly orthodox neoliberal
commitments and 2 for Personality Dependent since it was Lavin who
introduced the novel anti-politics discourse to an already established
party. Without him, the party would have continued to exist, but it
would not have taken its populist stance.

Neither immigration nor indigenous communities were a central element in
Lavin's campaign, and he has shown itself to be in favor of a better
recognition for the Mapuches (Emol, 2013) and for a regulated open
immigration policy. I have not found any indication of Violation of LD
norms. In fact, when he lost the election, he stood in the balcony of
the winner, Ricardo Lagos, as a way of signaling his commitment to
collaborate with the new government in a friendly manner (Silva, 2001:
35). I have coded 1 in these three categories.

Luna et al. (2013) point out that Lavin's candidacy implied a disrupture
in UDI's traditional politics. This disrupture did not continue after
Lavín's failed bids for president. In 2009, the leader of the Alliance
for Chile, was the candidate from the National Renovation, Sebastián
Piñera. In 2013, Evelyn Matthei, a former minister under Piñera's
government and member of UDI, was the candidate of the alliance and
again in 2017 Piñera was presented as the candidate for the right-wing
coalition. Both have explicitly rejected populist rhetoric (Emol, 2013b;
Romainville, 2018) and they are not treated as populist in the
scholarship. Moreover, it is not clear until what point the party did
change its position to a populist one under Lavín. It is perfectly
possible to consider Lavín's anti-political discourse exclusive of the
leader and not of the party. However, considering Lavín's role as the
leader of the party as the leader of the opposition for several years, I
have decided to leave the UDI in the dataset for the 2001 and 2005
legislative elections. However, I have not added the party before or
after Lavín's period.

## Communist Party / Together we can do more for Chile

There has been extensive debate over whether Communist and/or Socialist
ideologies are similar or dissimilar to populist discourses. Hawkins and
Rovira-Kaltwasser (2017) argue that the combination of Marxism and
populism is common in Chile, being Salvador Allende its prime example.

The Communist Party of Chile is "a revolutionary Party, which fights for
socialism and recognizes the driving role of the working class"
(Communist Party of Chile, 2002) that aims at the "suppression of all
forms of political, economic, social and cultural domination over the
people" (Communist Party of Chile, 2002). Although Marxist parties tend
to downplay their national ties in favor of internationalism while
populist parties are usually more nationalistic, the Chilean Communist
Party aims at combining the two by stating that its inspiration is
"national, patriotic, Latin Americanist and internationalist" (Communist
Party of Chile, 2002). Furthermore, the party is "anti-imperialistic"
and "fights for the self-determination of the peoples and is in
solidarity with all those who fight for their national independence, for
democracy, for socialism and peace." (Communist Party of Chile, 2002). I
have coded 3 for Financial Elite, Foreign Interests and Political Class
and "Far-Left" as its ideology.

Although the Communist party is a revolutionary party and "its sustained
on the ideas of Marx, Engels and Lenin" (Communist Party of Chile,
2002), it also proclaims that "because of its tradition and democratic
spirit, it fights for democracy as a form of political organization of
society" and that "its humanistic conception contains the principles of
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights" (Communist Party of Chile,
2002). I have not found actions carried out by the Communist Party in
this period that imply a violation of LD norms. I have coded this
category as a 2.

The party suffered persecution during the dictatorship and could not
compete in the first elections under its name. Since Allende's
government, the Communist party did not participate in the
administration and was not led by any charismatic leader. Therefore, I
have coded 3 for Military, and 1 for Insider Populism and Personality
Dependent.

In 2005, the party forms an electoral alliance with the Humanist party
called "Together we can do more for Chile" ("Juntos Podemos Más por
Chile") and presented their leader, Tomás Hirsch, as their candidate for
president. There were many ideological similarities between these two
parties and the Communist party remained as the largest party in the
coalition. Moreover, Hirsh campaigned on a progressive left-wing
platform similar to that of the Communist party (Angell and Reig, 2006).
Thus, I have kept the same coding as in the previous elections.

In 2009, 2013 and 2017 parliamentary elections, the Communist Party
became part of the electoral alliance of the "Concertación" and "Nueva
Mayoría" but obtained less than 5% of the votes. For the presidential
elections, the party presented a candidate, supported Bachelet's
candidacy for 2013 and her successor's in 2017. Thus, I have not coded
the Communist party for these years. In 2009, "Together we can do more
for Chile" presented Jorge Arrate as their presidential candidate. He
ran on similar ideas to what the party defended before.

## Marco Enríquez-Ominami

Marco Enríquez-Ominami, or MEO, as he is commonly known, is the son of a
guerrilla warrior killed by the military dictatorship. His family was
forced into exile and when he went back to Chile, he became known as a
TV host and as a movie director. He became a member of parliament in
2005 for the Socialist Party. In 2009, the left-wing electoral alliance
denied the possibility of holding fair primary elections and instead
chose former president Eduardo Frei as their candidate. Enríquez-Ominami
decided then to run for the presidency as an independent obtaining the
third position in the elections. He ran again in 2013 and in 2017,
although less successfully. I have labelled 1 for Insider Populism and 2
for Personality Dependent because the movement grew up from a general
social discontent with political parties at the time but his electoral
platform was entirely based on his persona.

The campaign of MEO was personalist, mediatic, with a strong emotional
speech, based on the closeness to the people and facing its other
contenders whom it identified as \"figures of the past\" (Dosek and
Freidenberg, 2014: 22). He wishes to distance himself from the old
political elite, which he considered that had "kidnapped politics and
did not offer a change for Chile" (Dosek and Freidenberg, 2014: 23). He
denounced that millions of Chileans were "outside of the political
process" and campaign to end that situation (Enríquez-Ominami, 2009).

MEO ran on a left-wing platform, based on promising free public
education and an increase of the minimum salary (Manifesto, 2009) but
his platform is not radical. He wished to "raise corporate taxes but
lower the income tax" and he "also expressed an openness to having the
state divest itself of a small stake of its copper Company" (Moffett and
Pica, 2009). Thus, his main target is the political class but not the
economic elite.

Enríquez-Ominami has a favorable position towards immigration and
indigenous communities in Chile, arguing that "a great deal of the
history of Chile is written together with Mapuches and immigrants" (CNN,
2017). I have labelled 1 for Immigration and Ethnic Others. I have not
found any reference that could be used to identify the military as an
enemy of the people in MEO's discourse.

Enríquez-Ominami has proclaimed the need to democratize the country,
regenerate politics, "combat social inequality and promoting regional
political unity" (Moffett and Pica, 2009). I have labelled 1 in LD norms
and 1 in Foreign Interests since he is in favor of deeper regional
integration and an open economy.

## Broad Front 

The Broad Front ("Frente Amplio") is a coalition of left-wing parties
created in 2017 in order to compete in the elections. Its origins can be
traced to the student protests of 2011 and the coalition includes a wide
variety of left and far-left parties with the exception of the Communist
party, which participated in the centre-left coalition. González Le Saux
exposes the Broad Front's vision of the economic and political system in
Chile:

> "From Frente Amplio\'s perspective, the bipartisan logic of compromise
> between the two ruling coalitions has allowed the neoliberal
> model-cemented during the country\'s 17-year dictatorship under
> Augusto Pinochet (1973-1990)-to continue, with only moderate reforms
> aimed at mitigating its most draconian consequences. Frente Amplio
> seeks to overcome a transitional order characterized by a neoliberal
> economy, export-driven extractivism, and the privatization of social
> rights in the realms of education, health, labor, and social security"
> González Le Saux, (2017).

It is a party that criticises harshly the establishment and wishes a
radical rupture with it: "Frente Amplio is appealing to the novelty and
integrity of its candidates, unpolluted by the links between money and
politics. Against the paternalistic and top down functioning of
traditional parties, it promotes a participatory style of politics"
(González Le Saux, 2017). The Broad Front, thus, has a "left-wing agenda
of anti-neoliberalism, environmentalism, pro-immigrant and LGBTQI
rights" (González Le Saux, 2017). I have coded 3 for Political Class,
Financial Elite and "Far-left" as ideology.

The presidential candidate was Beatriz Sánchez, a radio and TV host that
identified herself as "left-wing, but a very democratic left" and who
stresses the importance of discussion as a way of reaching agreements
(The Global Vote, 2017) (1 in Violation of LD norms). Sánchez never held
a position in government and did not belong to any party before 2017 (1
in Insider Populism). Since the party was created independently of
Sánchez and would have existed without her, I have coded 1 in
Personality Dependent.

She declares herself as a feminist candidate for the presidency and is a
defender of LGTB rights and abortion (The Global Vote, 2017).
Additionally, she is particularly critic with the sharp inequalities in
Chile: "The concentration of wealth is one of the highest in Latin
America. \[The rich should\] pay fair taxes. I don't want them not to
earn money, but to pay fair taxes." (The Global Vote, 2017).

The army received harsh criticism from Sanchez due to the lack of
governmental control over it (Sanchez, 2016). Moreover, she also argued
against the privileges the army has in comparison with other public
servants such as a better pension scheme or healthcare system (Sanchez,
2016). The reason for this, she argued, was that "there isn't a real
dominion of the Civil power over the military power" and urged to change
that situation (Sanchez, 2016). I have labelled 3 for Military.

On Foreign Interests, "the agenda is predominantly domestic, with
relatively little reference made to international affairs or Chile's
role in the world" (The Global Vote, 2017). I have not found nationalist
rhetoric nor the identification of external threats in Sanchez's
discourse (1 for Foreign Interests).

## José Antonio Kast

José Antonio Kast is a lawyer from a prominent political family in
Chile. He was a city councillor, a member of the chamber of deputies for
14 years and secretary general of the UDI. Kast was a well-known figure
of the most conservative current of the UDI and left the party in 2016
in order to run for president in the 2017 campaign on a more right-wing
and populist platform. He has professed many times its admiration for
Bolsonaro's defeat of the "corrupt left" (Tele13, 2018).

Kast is a strong supporter of the dictatorship of Pinochet, saying that
if Pinochet were alive, he would vote for him (Freixas, 2019). He
participated in the campaign for the YES to the dictatorship in the 1988
referendum and his brother, as one of the "Chicago Boys", actively
participated in Pinochet's government. Moreover, he asked for the
liberation of one of the torturers of the dictatorship (Freixas, 2019).
Kast is in favor of increasing military spending, stating that "the
armed forces, in justified cases and as a strictly exceptional measure,
will be able to collaborate in matters of public security when they are
required in order to fight terrorism and drug trafficking. Improvements,
innovation and new powers and attributions require a bigger budget. To
this end, the limits of the use of the Fund created by the Copper
Reserve Law will be revised so that these resources can be used to
increase the available military budget" (The Global Vote, 2017). 1 for
Military.

Kast is strongly opposed to abortion, feminism and LGBT rights and
considers the right-wing president, Sebastían Piñera as a "soft right"
for "lack of character" and for giving in to pressures from the
opposition" (Freixas, 2019). After the 2017 election, he created a new
party called Republican Action and its logo clearly references that of
the French Front National. On economic issues, he is committed to
neoliberal policies and argues for a small state that is free from
"politicking, privileges, duplicities or useless agencies" (Kast, 2017).

Given all the above I have coded Far Right as ideology, 3 for Political
Class, 3 for Violation of LD norms and 1 for Financial Elite and
Military.

On the relation between Chile and its neighbors, Kast displays a
nationalistic view and identifies physical barriers as the solution to
the long-standing territorial dispute with neighboring Bolivia. Kast
stated that "we want to reaffirm the autonomy of Chile and its
sovereignty that must be exercised in every corner of the country. For a
long time, we have been passive spectators of the communication abuses
of our neighbors of the northeast and we have not responded with
sufficient force and decision to the lies of the Bolivian government...
Physical barriers are required on the Chile-Peru and the Chile-Bolivia
border to support our police and to help to fight drug trafficking and
smuggling at the border. In addition, we need to incorporate more
technology for the detection and prosecution of border crimes" (The
Global Vote, 2017). 3 for Foreign Interests.

He is in favor of controlling migration, commenting that "those people
who are going to come must know that as of today, Chile is not ready to
receive all people." (The Global Vote, 2017). "But we must also be
rigorous in controlling our borders and in rejecting illegal immigration
in every event (The Global Vote, 2017). Additionally, Kast has been
criticized for "constructing a hate discourse regarding race, ethnicity
or sexual minorities" (Freixas, 2019). I have coded 3 for Immigration
and Ethnic Others.

Although Kast did not participate in the government, he was a prominent
member of the UDI for many years and secretary general of the party
before he decided to run as an independent. I have decided to code him
as 2 in Insider Populism. It is plausible to imagine that other
far-right parties could have emerged in the 2017 elections, but Kast's
movement was based on his personas as he ran as an independent and then
founded the party Republican Action. I believe this deserved a 2 in
Personality Dependent.
