  The case of India is difficult for several reasons. First, the sheer
  size of the country and its fragmented party system obscures some of the
  dynamics we're searching for. The Indian National Congress (INC) and the
  Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) are the only truly national parties in
  recent decades, but many state-based parties have mobilised on populist
  bases in individual areas which has shown up as only a fraction of the
  national electorate (Dravidian parties in Tamil Nadu and the Biju Janata
  Dal in Odisha are good examples of this). The fact that the major
  parties have formed alliances with these would suggest a case for coding
  the coalitions. But there is simply too much variation within these
  coalitions to justify this. The scale of national politics (and the
  diversity of issue-based mobilisation) also makes it difficult to say
  that any party relies on a single set of narratives and strategies, as
  these may vary from state to state. Second, the caste system and caste
  politics could be considered a mixture of class, religion, and
  ethnicity, meaning that caste-based political mobilisation is difficult
  to categorise along our OTH\_ variables. We have considered caste-based
  appeals to be OTH_ETHNIC for the purposes for our study, noting that we
  should return to this characterisation.

# Case notes

## Bharatiya Janata Party

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is India's largest right-wing party. As
the successor to the Jana Sangh party, it has long been the national
flagship party of "Hindutva" (Hindu nationalism) movement, and it is in
many ways the political wing of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)
volunteers movement (a Hindu nationalist paramilitary of sorts).
However, the party leadership has oscillated between its more liberal
and radical wings -- initially led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Lal
Krishna Advani respectively -- each presenting somewhat different
degrees of populism and ethnocentrism (Basu 2001; McGuire and Reeves
2003). The party's first stint in government (1998-04, led by Vajpayee)
is generally seen to have come during one of its more moderate phases,
and did not include radical policy changes on the key Hindutva issues
such as the Ram temple dispute, Kashmir's constitutional autonomy, or a
uniform civil code. As with other major Indian parties, the party has
rarely run true national campaigns, but rather tailored its message to
individual states (Palshikar 2015, 725). Narendra Modi became the
party's candidate for Prime Minister for the 2014 election and led it to
its most successful period to-date, capturing a majority in the Lok Saba
and growing it in the subsequent 2019 election. The BJP has frequently
been described as populist (see McDonnell and Cabrera 2019; Saleem 2021;
McGuire and Reeves 2003), especially under Modi's leadership.

The party has always attempted to cast the Congress-led political class
as a corrupt ruling elite estranged form the people (Jaffrelot
1993:317). In its 1984 manifesto it claimed that "an unholy nexus has
developed between the corrupt politicians, the corrupt bureaucrats and
the corrupt businessmen" (cited in Malik and Singh 1994, 68). The BJP
characterisations of the elite naturally focussed on the Congress Party,
which it described as an irredeemably corrupt entity in service of the
Gandhi family rather than the Indian people (McDonnell and Cabrera 2019,
489). Its conception of the "elite" has also extended to Judges, NGO
leaders and other established political parties who were accused of
monopolising power and pandering to non-Hindu minorities (McDonnell and
Cabrera 2019; Chacko 2018, 543; Sajjanhar 2021, 2). The damage done by
this elite to ordinary Indian people was considered by the BJP as
intentional and self-serving. "\[A\]ll pervasive" corruption, according
to the party, was not just the work of bad apples, but "reflect\[ed\]
the bad intentions of those in power" (Chacko 2018, 554). In Modi's own
words (in 2014) "This country is not poor. The people of this rich
country have been kept poor because of politics" (Jaffrelot 2015, 153).
On multiple policy issues, Modi contrasted the will of the people with
politicians. He declared that foreign policy, for example "should be
decided by the people and not by some politicians sitting in Delhi"
(Wojczewski 2020, 406). As with other variables, there is a case for
OTH_POLCLASS to be coded 3 for at least parts of the BJP's inclusion I
the dataset. However as the scale and diversity for the party message is
so significant, we've left this at 2 for now.

The party's representation of Hindutva cultural majoritarianism has long
associated it with political hostility to non-Hindu minorities,
especially Muslims. While the party's official rhetoric has often been
careful to not declare an open hostility to Muslims in violation of the
secular constitution (McDonnell and Cabrera 2019, 491), Muslims have
always been accused by the BJP of receiving the favour of Congress for
its own interests, and were generally constructed as a default "other"
to the Hindu majority (Nielsen and Nilsen 2021, 92; McGuire and Reeves
2003, 97; Kaul 2017, 525). In the context of India's geopolitical
tensions with Pakistan, Muslims were often cast as a security threat.
While the party has avoided the harshest anti-Muslim rhetoric from the
top, various incidents by key leaders have indelibly linked its identity
with anti-Muslim hostility. Advani made himself and the BJP the face of
the Ayodhya dispute in the 1990s, which essentially drummed up an
anti-Muslim pogrom in the name of rectifying the alleged destruction of
the Ram Janmabhoomi Temple centuries earlier. There is an argument
(Jaffrelot 2013) that the party radicalised in the 1989-1996 period
under Advani's leadership, during which it abandoned an attempt to woo
coalition parties and mobilised heavily on the Ram Temple issue. However
we don't think this quite elevates the party to a 3 on OTH_ETHNIC. As
leader, Modi talked almost exclusively about the economy in his first
election and relied on others to make the Hindutva case (McDonnell and
Cabrera 2019, 492). His image as a Hindutva hardliner was enabled more
by his controversial handling of communal violence in the 2002 Gujarat
riots as Chief Minister of that state. A number of the party's actions
in government bolstered its anti-Muslim image. For example it attempted
to pass a controversial amendment to the Citizenship Act which would
have granted citizenship to migrants as long as they were not Muslim (G.
Singh 2019, 316). Given the varying strains of ethnocentric rhetoric
across the enormous party, we have kept it at 2 on OTH_ETHNIC for the
duration.

The BJP's policies and rhetoric under Modi have been described as
"business friendly" (Chacko 2018, 554; see also Kaul 2017), and apart
from occasionally accusing the Congress party of being linked with
corrupt businesses (see above), the party's rhetoric could not be
considered against economic or financial elites in any significant way.
This is in tune with Modi's market based "Gujarat Model" of development
and growth. Texts on the pre-Modi BJP don't suggest that the party was
fundamentally hostile to financial elites, the wealthy or big businesses
then either. According to Kaul ( 2017, 525), the party was perceived in
the early 1990s as a "party of middle-class commercial traders". It is
therefore coded OTH_ECONOMIC = 1 for the full period of its inclusion in
the dataset. In the Modi era anti-Muslim rhetoric often overlapped with
anti-immigrant rhetoric (McDonnell and Cabrera 2019, 491), particularly
relating to Bangladeshi migrants who were considered the latest attempt
by Congress to build a "vote bank" to keep them in power (Wojczewski
2020, 406). We've not found references to immigrants in the pre-Modi
BJP, so OTH_IMMIGRANTS are coded 1 until 2014 and 2 after (this could be
investigated further).

In conventional nationalist terms, Pakistan and China featured in BJP
campaigns when portrayed as a beneficiary of Congress's policies, and
the party has generally benefited from military flare ups with Pakistan
in Kashmir. This has often taken the form of collaborationist
allegations against Congress: in one speech Modi asserted that if the
government was "patriotic" they would put a stop to the violence on the
disputed Chinese and Pakistani borders (Wojczewski 2020, 407). The BJP
and its affiliates in the Modi era have also equated the Congress-led
elite with the British colonial mission to divide and weaken India, and
continuing to do their work under the guise of secularism (Wojczewski
2020, 406). Enemies like NGOs and student activists were often portrayed
by the party as betraying India's national sovereignty due to their
foreign values and links (McDonnell and Cabrera 2019). None of this
quite reaches the level of 3 on OTH_FOREIGN, so it has been coded 2. The
BJP has always been a very pro-military party (OTH_MILITARY = 1).

The party's consistent association with RSS and Ker Sevak militants and
acts of communal violence against Muslims are the strongest evidence on
the LIBDEMNORMS variable. Although the relationship between the Modi's
BJP and the RSS is arguably more distant than earlier (Palshikar 2015,
721), the attachment is still an important feature of the party. There
have also been attacks on Dalit protesters under the BJP's rule which
the party has been silent on (McDonnell and Cabrera 2019, 494). Modi and
his campaign have also demonised the mainstream (particularly English
language) media, portraying him as a victim of their conspiracy, and in
government Modi weakened the Supreme Court's independence (Chakravartty
and Roy 2015, 316; McDonnell and Cabrera 2019, 493). In Kaul's words,
Modi's government delivered an "increase in political and economic
violence and overt intimidation at all levels of society accompanied by
plummeting levels of media freedom, a consolidation and centralization
of power, and an openly hostile attitude to secularism and democratic
principles" (Kaul 2017, 529)*.* We have coded the party 2 on LIBDEMNORMS
for the entire period, although this could be revisited.

The party has consistently been described as right-wing (Nielsen and
Nilsen 2021, 92), and in the Modi era economically neo-liberal. R on
LRPOSITION seems appropriate. Given the established institutions and
identity of the BJP, it is not evident that the party has ever owed its
existence to its serving leader. This is true even for the charismatic
Modi -- as McDonnel and Cabera (2019, 485) state, "\[h\]owever popular
or powerful Modi is, the party will survive him." Numerous accounts of
Modi's two elections, however, state that his persona was immensely
important to the BJP's collective meaning and performance to a degree
unprecedented in recent Indian elections (Jaffrelot 2015; Wojczewski
2020, 405; Kaul 2017, 528). His personal image and strategy presented
him with an "direct and institutionally unmediated relationship to his
followers" (Subedi and Scott 2021, 497). For this reason we have coded 1
on CHARISMA until 2014 and 2 for Modi's two elections.

## Bahujan Samaj Party

The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) was founded in 1984 by Dalit activist
Kanshi Ram and led since 2003 by his appointed successor Mayawati. Both
Ram and Mayawati are followers B.R. Ambedkar's tradition of lower caste
politics and critique of the Hindu system. The party has its roots in
Uttar Pradesh (UP), but has also been present in other states in
northern India. The BSP is dedicated to providing a political voice to
those at the lower end of the caste system (The name Bahujan Samaj means
"majority community"). It peaked in performance around the 1990s and
2000s, when Mayawati served four short stints as UPs Chief Minister. Due
to its rhetoric against the upper castes the BSP has frequently been
considered populist (Subramanian 2007; Lerche 1999). This is another
party whose significance is understated by the scale of national
politics, given its relatively small national footprint belies its
success as a mass movement.

The party has attempted to win the support of lower caste (especially
Dalit) constituencies who have hitherto traditionally supported the
Congress Party. While this was initially limited to a few specific
castes in the party's early years, it grew to include a broader
coalition of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (SC/STs), Other
Backward Castes (OBCs), and religious minorities in the 1990s (Guha
2013, 6; Sarkar 2021, 73). The BSP accused Congress of treating lower
castes as "vote banks", providing token benefits to excluded groups but
acting as vehicles for the upper caste elite that usually led the party
(Guha 2011, 1--2; Pai 2009, 339; S. Kumar 2017). While Congress was the
principle object of the BSPs critique, Kanshi Ram made it clear that
their tactics were shared by the other major parties, such as the BJP
and the communist parties, all of which "uphold consciously the
degrading character of the social and political system" (Sarkar 2021,
67). In Guha's words *"*The BSP's depiction of the Bahujan Samaj ('the
community of the majority') turned on a binary that pitted it against
Hindu upper castes, who were portrayed as constituting both its
political and ideological 'other' " (Guha 2013, 1; see also Gundimeda
2014, 26).

Both Ram and Mayawati have relied on very provocative and exclusionary
discourse against the upper castes to mobilise its base. For example Ram
often began his speeches by inviting any upper caste attendees to leave
the venue, and Mayawati has called Mahatma Gandhi the "son of Satan"
(Jaffrelot 1998, 38, 46). According to Singh (2019, 48--49), one of the
party's "signature slogan\[s\]" was "we have the votes, you have the
power, this will not last, this will not last". In UP, other "deeply
offensive" slogans were chanted in public BSP processions in public
areas to antagonise upper castes (Duncan 1999, 45; see also Gundimeda
2014, 27--28). A study in Punjab noted that the party recruited voters
by insisting that various material compensations by the Congress
government do not compensate for the humiliation of the Hindu caste
system, the elite of which still governs them in the political class
(Chandra 2000). The BSP generally softened its rhetoric against the
upper casts in the late 1990s and early 2000s, to the extant that
Mayawati tried extensively to recruit upper caste members into the party
(V. Kumar 2007; Pai 2009, 345; N. Singh 2019, 49; Gundimeda 2014, 28).
However, it still emphasised that upper castes were generally
untrustworthy and maintained its general posture of hostility towards
them. Owing to this shift, we've coded BSP as 3 on OTH_ETHNIC in the
elections up to 1999, and 2 from the 2004 general election on, though
this could be revisited. Given that the BSP essentially linked upper
caste ethnicity with political power, we've taken this as OTH_POLCLASS
rhetoric as well. However given that the OTH_POLCLASS dimension of this
did not soften as the party tried to bring in upper caste members (on
the contrary, it alleged that upper castes too had been abandoned by the
elites), we have kept OTH_POLCLASS at 3 for the duration of BSP's
inclusion in the dataset.

Given the overlap between political and economic dimensions of the
castes system, one might expect there to be a degree of hostility
towards economic "others" like businesses and the wealthy. However this
appears not to be the case, as several scholars have noted that the
party does not actually campaign on economic issues relating to
class-based material redistribution, but rather caste exclusion in
strictly social, cultural, and political contexts (Duncan 1999, 36;
Chandra 2000). According to Singh (writing on Punjab), the BSP had no
social or political programme, relying instead on identity (N. Singh
2019, 51). In Duncan's words "it's appeal and campaigning appear to be
far more caste based than class oriented and it has been primarily
concerned with issues of social oppression and exclusion than with those
relating to economic exploitation" (Duncan 1999, 36). For this reason,
we've coded it 1 on OTH_ECONOMIC. The literature similarly presents no
evidence of a significant hostility to the military, immigrants, or
foreign powers in the BSP's discourse(OTH_MILITARY = 1, OTH+FOERIGN = 1,
OTH_IMMIGRANTS = 1).

Despite being an "ethnic party", the BSP in government or opposition has
not been affiliated with communal violence in the same way as the BJP
has (N. Singh 2019), and there is little evidence that is poses a threat
to established liberal democratic norms (LIBDEMNORMS = 1). The party's
heavy association with Ram and now Mayawati (257) earn it a consistent 2
on CHARISMA.

## Not included

The Indian National Congress was the dominant party in India for several
decades after independence, and was led by Jawaharlal Nehru with a
centre-left non-populist platform. When his daughter Indira Gandhi tool
over the party in 1966 she took control from decentralised party bosses
by building a more personalist leadership with direct communication to
the masses and constructed a brand of left wing agrarian populism
against local political elites (Kenny 2017). This was well established
by the early 1970s, but according to most sources (Subramanian 2007) she
toned this down in her second stint in power 1980-84 (only the 1980
election would fall within our time frame). That said, it may be the
case that her 1980 election campaign should be considered in more
detail. Owing to the lack of clear evidence on this campaign, we're
omitted it from the dataset.
