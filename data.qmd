# Coding definitions and rules

WPD codes parties and candidates (henceforth "parties/candidates") that
win at least 5% of the vote in national legislative and executive
elections in 50 countries (henceforth "cases"). By "candidate", we only
mean candidates in executive elections, not all candidates from parties
in legislative elections.

WPD only includes parties/candidates that meet a minimum definition of
populism defined below. Included entries are then coded on variables
that differentiate qualities and attributes of their populism.
Parties/candidates are listed for each election type, including multiple
rounds of presidential elections, and multiple systems of legislative
elections (e.g. simultaneous proportionate and constituency systems),
with results from each.

## Populism (minimum definition)

Parties/candidates are only included in the dataset if their discourse
during the election campaign under analysis meets the our minimum
definition of populism as a *discourse asserting that political power
has been monopolised by an elite estranged from ordinary people, and
that salient grievances of ordinary people can be attributed to the
self-serving decisions of that elite.*

This definition has two components. First, candidates/parties must claim
or imply that ordinary people are systematically excluded from political
power, and that a small group of people - commonly the "elite" or
similar terms - has monopolised this power.

"Ordinary people" in this definition can take many different forms,
including ethnic, racial, native, regional, class, generational, or
other characteristics. It can also be an undefined and residual
category, in the sense of being all people *other* than the elite.
Candidates/parties do not need to use terms like "the people" in order
to infer the existence of this people/elite dichotomy. Nor do they need
to express any affinity with the cultural traits or values of ordinary
people.

The "elite" can also take many different forms, including incumbent
politicians and parties, racial or ethnic groups, businesses, oligarchs,
media figures or others. Unlike the "people", the "elite" cannot be an
undefined or residual category to meet our definition: it must be
explicitly referred to by candidates/parties. This group may be
collectivised by terms like "the elite", "the establishment" (or bespoke
alternatives), or evoked by referencing sets of actors or groups who
have monopolised political power. As implied by the definite article in
these terms, "the" elite must be considered to be an essentially
singular actor, if not a totally homogenous one.

Second, populism manifests in an election campaign by the accusation
that the salient grievances faced by ordinary people are a direct
consequence of the actions of the elite, which benefits from those
actions on a zero-sum basis with the people's detriment. Ordinary
people's suffering must therefore be attributed to some form of
corruption by the power-weiding elite which has deliberately constructed
the *status quo* for its own benefit.

Attributing grievances in this way is different to attributing them to
factors like flawed ideas/ideologies, ignorance, or incompetence on the
part of the elite (although populists may make these claims as well).
This is because each of these grievance attributions could plausibly
exist in an elite which, while powerful, means well for the people, and
is not essentially corrupt. On the contrary, populist grievance
attribution makes a moral claim about the actions of the elite,
asserting that they deliberately serve themselves at the expense of
ordinary people.

This second component is essential for differentiating between populism
and non-populist forms of anti-elitism. It is common for non-populist
candidates/parties to campaign with some form of anti-elitism that fits
the first component of the minimum definition but not the second. Such
is the case when politicians accuse opponents of being estranged from
ordinary people's conditions, hostile to the cultures and behaviours of
ordinary people, or partial to the company of powerful figures rather
than ordinary people. While these elements of anti-elitism are common in
populist discourses too, their presence in campaign discourse is
insufficient to fulfil our minimum definition of populism unless the
elite is also accused of deliberately causing the problems affecting
ordinary people for their own benefit.

This second component, while often mentioned in the populism literature,
has not yet been included in the minimum definitions of other populism
datasets.

### Locating populism

As our minimum definition states, WPD considers populism to be a
discourse. Due to this, we have not considered candidate/parties'
programmatic policy in either the application of our minimum definition
of populism, not any of our variables with the exception of LRPOSITION
(see below). If, for example, a candidate wins office in an election in
which they employed populist discourse, but then does not actually do
anything to curb the power of their supposed elite adversaries when they
are in office, this has no bearing on whether that candidate is in fact
a populist in prior or subsequent elections in WPD.

This also means that we are not interested in the true underlying
beliefs of populist candidates/parties that may contradict their
discourse. If, for example, a presidential candidate campaigns against
"the elite" in line with our minimum definition, but there is evidence
to suggest that they actually have deep respect and reverence for
political elites (from sources like interviews or autobiographies), then
we code according to the former data, not the latter.

Similarly, we make no moral or judgements about the potential merit of
any instance of populist discourse in any coding decision. That is,
whether we happen to believe that the populist interpretation (as
defined above) is an accurate and therefore "justified" representation
of the polity under observation is irrelevant to our decision to include
or exclude it from the dataset. "Populism" is therefore a morally
neutral term in the dataset.

Generally, we have assumed that populist characteristics of
candidates/parties' discourse are carried over from one election period
to another, such that we do not require fresh evidence for each election
period. In cases where we do find evidence that candidate/parties have
changed over time we factor this into our coding, and as a result there
are many candidates/parties that enter in and out of the dataset over
time.

### Difficult cases 

There are many types of discourse or political scenario that are
questionable inclusions within this minimum definition. We have
developed the following rules to clarify our application of it.

*Non-populist "outsiders"*. Many candidates/parties campaign as
"outsiders" to existing systems, often as "third parties" outside of
two-party systems, and in doing so take on a kind of holistic
anti-status quo discourse. Ross Perot in the United States and Emmanuel
Macron in France are good examples of this. While these are occasionally
classified as populist because of their catch-all criticisms of the
political system, we do not code them as populists unless their
opposition to the system meets the second element of the minimum
definition (that the salient grievances of ordinary people can be
attributed to the self-serving decisions of that elite) - which neither
Perot nor Macron do.

*Incumbents*. When populist candidates/parties win elections and form
government, they can still engage in populist discourse to discuss
"elites" as a powerbloc even though they are in power. Often this refers
to powerbrokers in the state bureaucracy, judicial system, media or
business class rather than incumbent politicians. It can also evoke a
kind of phantom establishment or elite that is present in the polity yet
temporarily out of office. Nicol√°s Maduro in Venezuela is a good example
of this. Because of this, we don't exclude incumbent candidates/parties
due to the fact that they are in power.

*Post-authoritarian parties/candidates.* Many cases coded in WPD have
emerged from periods of authoritarian rule. When parties/candidates in
elections immediately following these transitions campaign with
discourse that meets the above definition, but the targets of their
anti-elite rhetoric are the former regime rather than their contemporary
opponents, then we have generally not considered them as populist. Lech
Walesa in Poland or Corazon Aquino in the Philippines are good examples
of this.

*Satirical candidates*. In a small number of cases, candidates/parties
campaign as "satirical" candidates who deliberately mock and ridicule
the elite whilst not really claiming to be genuine alternatives. As
these are often considered "protest" parties, we have coded them as
populist when their act has an underlying message of corruption similar
to our minimum definition. Estonia's Independent Royalists are a good
example of this.

*Communist parties*. As communist parties always critique the
differential between powerful and powerless classes in political
systems, there is an argument that this meets our minimum definition of
populism. However, we find that communist (more specifically Marxist)
discourse considers the role of elites to be more epiphenomenal to the
overall system (capitalism) rather than as true agents in control of it,
which is different to the first element of our minimum definition. For
this reason we have generally not coded communist parties as populist,
other than when their leaders have explicitly engaged in discourse that
meets our minimum definition.

*Anti-corruption politicians.* While the second component of our minimum
definition requires candidates/parties to allege some form of corruption
among their opponents, this does not mean that any anti-corruption
discourse qualifies as populist. Anti-corruption discourse is only
populist by our definition when the elite *writ large* are accused of
being essentially and systematically corrupt - not just that there are
significant cases of corruption in the *status quo*. In such cases,
parties/candidates would be meeting the second element of the minimum
definition (corrupt motives as a cause of ordinary people's problems)
but not the first (power monopolised by a unitary elite).

**Variables**

When parties fit the above minimum definition, WPD codes them on a
number of variables relating to core features of their populism and
other attributes.

### "Others" and enemies of the ordinary people

The first set of variables relate to who the main "others" or "elites"
are relative to the party/candidate's discourse. Some form of this
rhetoric is present in all forms of populism (as our minimal definition
requires), but it can take varying and occasionally overlapping forms.
Parties/candidates can also change their "others"/"elites" over time,
representing subtly different forms of populism in different elections.

For each variable we use a 3-level ordinal categorisation where 1 = no,
2 = present, and 3 = yes.

#### OTH_POLCLASS

*Does the party/candidate claim that the political class - incumbent
politicians, parties, bureaucrats, judges, and other holders of state
office - are the "elite" or "others" to ordinary people and their
interests?*

> 1\. (No) Party/candidate does not utilise anti-political class
> discourse.
>
> 2\. (Partial) Party/candidate is critical of political class in a way
> that lacks the consistency, clarity, or ferocity of 3 (strong).
>
> 3\. (Yes) Party/candidate considers the political class to be the or a
> core element of the "elite/other", or direct representatives of that
> "elite" or "other", and therefore responsible for the grievances of
> ordinary people

OTH_POLCLASS gauges the candidate/party's characterisation of
established political figures as an essentially unified group of people
hostile to the interests of ordinary people -- which we refer to as
anti-political class discourse. This is perhaps the most commonly cited
attribute of populist discourse, and unsurprisingly the great majority
of entries in the dataset are coded 3 or 3. It is commonly evoked by the
references populists often make to "the establishment" of political
decision makers whom they accuse of siding with the "elite", or
constituting the essence of "the elite" themselves.

Incumbent politicians are the most common figures of the "political
class" but we also include other figures more tangentially connected to
the political system and/or the state, like former politicians, party
officials, bureaucrats and civil servants, and judicial figures.

As the word "class" suggests, OTH_POLCLASS rhetoric must collectivise
these actors in a way that presents them as a somewhat unified grouping,
often emphasising that differences between them (like parties and
official ideologies) are superficial and meaningless. Consider for
example the assertion by the Palikot Movement of Poland that it was "not
the next configuration of the same old elite\...AWS, PiS, PO, ZChN, PC,
KPN, ROP, and now PJN -- different names, but the same people."

OTH_POLCLASS discourse does not imply that parties/candidates must
criticise all actors in political class equally, but just that there
must be some implication that the bulk of "the" political class acts as
a somewhat homogenous entity. Populists frequently create terms like
"the network", "the caste", "the political mafia" to collectivise the
political class in their rhetoric.

Parties/candidates are coded 3 on this scale when these references are
core and consistent elements of their characterisation of elites. This
includes cases where parties/candidates claim that other groups are also
essential components of the elite, but that the political class acts as
a corrupt accomplice to their actions. For example, Jean-Luc Melenchon
(France) and Ollanta Humala (Peru) both employed OTH_POLCLASS discourse
at a level befitting 3 on this scale, although both claimed that other
elements (economic elites and foreign powers in both cases) were equally
core components of the "elite" opposed to the interests of ordinary
citizens. Conversely, some parties - such as Italy's Five Star Movement
in its first election in 2013 - considered the political class as the
singular essense of the elite.

There are very few cases of parties/candidates coded as 1 on this
variable. In these cases populist discourse is always employed against
other "elites". Examples of this are the Estonian National Independence
Party, and the Taiwan Solidarity Movement, both of which focused mainly
on foreign powers rather than the domestic political class.

Parties/candidates coded as 2 employ some degree of this discourse, but
without the clarity, consistency, or degree to reach the level of 3 as
defined above. Bulgaria's National Movement Simeon II and New Zealand's
Social Credit Party are good examples of this relatively moderate
OTH_POLCLASS discourse.

OTH_POLCLASS discourse can be used by candidates against their own
parties. The presidential campaigns of Donald Trump (United States) and
Jacob Zuma (South Africa), for example, employed this rhetoric against
established political figures within the Republican Party and the
African National Congress, respectively.

OTH_POLCLASS discourse can also be employed by candidates/parties who
are incumbent in office. Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan, for example,
only reached a 3 on our OTH_POLCLASS classification during the 2014
election, at which point he and his AK Party had been in power for over
a decade.

#### OTH_ECONOMIC

*Does party/candidate claim that economic elites - big business, the
wealthy, financiers, oligarchs or other economic powerbrokers - are the
"elite" or "others" to ordinary people and their interests?*

> 1\. (No) Party/candidate does not define the "elite/other" in economic
> terms.
>
> 2\. (Partial) Party/candidate is critical of economic elites in a way
> that lacks the consistency, clarity, or ferocity of 3.
>
> 3\. (Yes) Party/candidate claims economic elites are core elements of
> the "elite" or "other" responsible for the grievances of ordinary
> people.

OTH_ECONOMIC discourse is present when candidates allege that economic
elites -- which refers to big business, billionaires, oligarchs,
financiers, wealthier social classes, etc. -- are an element of the
elite. This can take the form of ideologically rich discourses about
inequality or capitalism, such as Die Linke in Germany, Syriza in
Greece, and Hugo Chavez's Fifth Republic Movement in Venezuela -- each
of which are socialist parties that consider the "people" and "elite" to
be principally class divisions in the material sense. It can also exist
in less ideologically defined opposition to the power of businesses or
wealthy individuals, such as with the ideologically ambiguous New
Zealand First party, or the centrist anti-oligarch Zatlers Reform Party
in Latvia.

It is also often the case that candidates/parties usually characterised
as right wing in the sense of ethno-nationalism, immigration, or social
conservatism evoke their supporters' hostility to economic elites in a
similar way to leftists. The more recent campaigns of the far right
Front National in France are a good example of this. In other cases,
right wing populists like Iceland's Progressive Party or Greece's
Independent Greeks have turned to OTH_ECONOMIC discourse in the wake of
financial crises. The economic ideology of candidates/parties and its
perceived effect on economic powerbrokers is not relevant to our
OTH_ECONOMIC coding decisions. For example, a party/candidate may
endorse a neoliberal economic ideology that would serve the interests of
economic powerbrokers while still engaging in OTH_ECONOMIC discourse.

It is often difficult to disentangle OTH_ECONOMIC discourse from other
OTH\_ variables. It is frequently the case that opposition to economic
powerbrokers is constructed in nationalist terms, with populists
specifically opposing "foreign" businesses or billionaires. Likewise,
opposition to domestic economic elites can overlap with ethnic or racial
rhetoric, as in the case of South Africa's Economic Freedom Fighters
(EFF). In such cases we have still considered such rhetoric OTH_ECONOMIC
as long as discourse is still constructed in economic terms (which it
does in the case of EFF's).

However, when discourse against one or few economic elites appears to
have more to do with an incidental personal feud than an opposition to
the wealth of those figures *per se* we have erred on the side of not
considering this OTH_ECONOMIC discourse. Viktor Orban's hostility to the
influence of expatriate billionaire George Soros in Hungary (which also
takes on anti-semstic overtones) is a good example of populist
opposition to wealthy individuals that is not truly OTH_ECONOMIC
discourse.

Consistent with our approach of coding discourse rather than policy, we
ignore policy proposals that conflict with this discourse. That is, when
a candidate/party claims that billionaires are an enemy of the people,
but advocates cutting taxes on the wealthy or liberalising financial
regulations, we code according to the former rather than the latter.

#### OTH_MILITARY

*Does party/candidate claim that the national military are the "elite"
or "others" to ordinary people and their interests?*

> 1\. (No) The military does not feature in the party/candidate's
> construction of the "elite/other".
>
> 2\. (Partial) The party/candidate is critical of the military's
> involvement in politics in a way that lacks the consistency, clarity,
> or ferocity of 3.
>
> 3\. (Yes) The party/candidate considers the military to be core
> elements of the "elite" or "other" responsible for the grievances of
> ordinary people.

OTH_MILITARY discourse is present when populist candidates/parties
allege that military establishments are elements of the elite and
hostile to the people's interest. This is particularly prevalent in
cases where prior military regimes are seen to remain as political foils
after transitions (such as Argentina or the Pakistan), or where the
military habitually intervenes in the political process (such as Turkey
or Thailand). However this needn't be evident for OTH_MILITARY discourse
to be present.

Codings of 3 are used when OTH_MILITARY discourse is a clear and
prominent element of populist rhetoric, for example Thailand's Pheu Thai
party, or Argentina's Front for Victory, each of which characterise the
military establishment as core opponents of the people in the popuilst
terms of our minimum definition.

Codings of 2 are reserved for relatively milder forms which are neither
absent nor strong, such as Brazil's Workers Party (in the 1980s and
1990s).

#### OTH_ETHNIC

*Does party/candidate claim that specific ethnic, racial or religious
groups are the "elite" or "others" to ordinary people and their
interests?*

> 1\. (No) Party/candidate does not characterise the "elite" or
> \"others\" in ethnic/racial/religious terms
>
> 2\. (Partial) Party/candidate is critical of ethnic/racial/religious
> groups in a way that lacks the consistency, clarity, or ferocity of 3.
>
> 3\. (Yes) The party/candidate considers ethnic/racial/religious groups
> to be core elements of the "elite" or "other" responsible for the
> grievances of ordinary people.

OTH_ETHNIC discourse occurs when parties/candidates characterise the
categories of "elite", or "other" in ethnic, racial, or religious terms.
Parties/candidates are coded 3 when this is a clear and prominent
element of populist discourse. Relevant out-groups can be either
domestic minorities/majorities, or local representatives of
transnational groups such as religions, races, or Roma.

There is a significant range within the level 3 category, as we consider
extreme cases such as Golden Dawn in Greece or Vladimir Zhirinovski's
Liberal Democratic Party in Russia and the somewhat milder cases like
France's Front National or Australia's One Nation party equally fitting
of the language of level 3 here - even though they differ on the degree
of their and content OTH_ETHNIC rhetoric.

The coding of 2 is used for relatively milder form of OTH_ETHNIC
discourse among populists. This includes candidates/parties who make
occasional references to ethnic/racial/religious groups in ways that are
discursively salient enough to surpass a 1 (null) coding, but not enough
to reach 3. Iceland's Progressive Party, and the New Zealand First party
are examples of this.

Category 2 is also used for candidates/parties who rely on deeper
legacies of ethnic/racial/religious discourse and action rather than
contemporary rhetoric, such that neither category 1 nor 3 is
appropriate. An examples of this Narendra Modi in India (who's
controversial handling of inter-communal riots in Gujarat in 2002 made
him an icon of broader Hindu majoritarian politics).

We consider regional (including separatist) parties to engage in
OTH_ETHNIC discourse when differentials between regions are defined in
ethnic, racial or religious terms. Canada's Bloc Quebecois and Belgium's
Flemish Bloc are examples of this.

While many parties/candidates define the "people" in ethnic, racial, or
religious terms, we do not require this to code 2 or 3 on the OTH_ETHNIC
variable. This is because there are many examples of parties/candidates
who present somewhat liberal or multicultural representations of people,
but still focus specifically on an opposition to one or more ethnic,
racial or religious groups in a way befitting level 3 on this scale.
Geert Wilders' Party for Freedom is a good example.

#### OTH_IMMIGRANTS

*Does the party/candidate claim that immigrants are the "elite" or
"others" to ordinary people and their interests?*

> 1\. (No) Immigrants are irrelevant to party/candidates
> characterisations of "elites" or "others\".
>
> 2\. (Partial) Party/candidate is critical of immigrants in a way that
> lacks the consistency, clarity, or ferocity of 3 (strong).
>
> 3\. (Yes) The party/candidate considers immigrants to be core elements
> of the "elite" or "other" responsible for the grievances of ordinary
> people.

OTH_IMMIGRANTS discourse occurs when parties/candidates characterise
immigrants as a threat to the interests of the ordinary people.
Immigrants are rarely considered to be a component of the "elite", but
often constitute an "other" that is favoured by the elite over ordinary
people. Parties/candidates are coded 3 when this is a clear and
prominent element of populist discourse. The UK Independence Party and
Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro are examples of this.

Level 2 is used on this variable when parties/candidates utilise some
degree of anti-immigrant discourse that lacks the consistency, clarity,
or ferocity of true anti-immigrant discourse. An example here is the
ideologically ambiguous Five Star Movement in Italy, whose populism was
(initially) centred on its ridicule of the political class, but in later
elections included some anti anti-immigrant narratives.

There are many cases where OTH_IMMIGRANTS discourse overlaps with
OTH_ETHNIC discourse. The Slovenian Democratic Party of Janez Jan≈°a for
example has long been opposed to immigrants from other former
Yugoslavian states in ways that correlated with ethnocentric narratives
of Slovenian nationalism. This is not always the case however, such as
with the example of Carl Hagen's Progress Party in Norway, which became
strongly anti-immigrant in the mid-1990s but in a way that related more
to welfare chauvinism than explicit ethno-nationalism.

In cases where parties are opposed to immigrants from certain countries
or ethnic backgrounds but supportive of immigrants from others, we still
consider this OTH_IMMIGRANT discourse. Pakistan's Muhajir Qaumi Movement
is a good example of this. As with other variables, we ignore actual
policy proposals relating to immigration and focus on campaign discourse
against immigrants (although these are naturally correlated).

#### OTH_FOREIGN

*Does party/candidate claim foreign entities - states, institutions or
other entities - are the "elite" or "others" to ordinary people and
their interests?*

> 1\. (No) Foreign entities do not feature in party/candidate's
> characterisations of "elites" or "others".
>
> 2\. (Partial) Party/candidate is critical of foreign entities but does
> not consider their domestic opponents to be totally subservient to
> them
>
> 3\. (Yes) Party/candidate claims that their domestic opponents are
> totally controlled by and loyal to foreign interests hostile to
> ordinary people.

OTH_FOREIGN discourse occurs when parties/candidates claim that the
elite responsible for the grievances of ordinary people is a foreign
actor (or actors) of some kind. These foreign actors are usually foreign
governments, but can also be supernational/regional entities like the
European Union, or global institutions like the IMF or World bank. It
can also include less well-defined references to "globalist" actors or
agendas. We do not consider immigrants from other countries to be
"foreign entities".

In order to fit our minimum definition of populism, OTH_FOREIGN populism
must assert that foreign power is in some ways exerted through domestic
figures, be they in the political class, business, domestic ethnic
groups or other.

OTH_FOREIGN discourse does not require parties/candidates to be
consistently against all foreign entities in the sense of ideological
isolationism and/or nationalism, only that foreign entities be among the
elites and others responsible for the grievances experienced by ordinary
people. Parties/candidates may therefore practice OTH_FOREIGN discourse
when they are in favour of some foreign entities. As with other
variables, this can be the only OTH\_ variable, or can exist alongside
others.

Level 3 is reserved for cases where parties/candidates accuse their
domestic opponents of being wholly controlled by or representative of
these foreign interests. Examples of this are Bolivia's Movement for
Socialism and Greece's PASOK (in the 1980s).

Level 2 is used when parties/candidates consistently refer to the
influence of foreign entities without reaching this threshold. Examples
of this are the Japanese Restoration Party or Mexico's Party of the
Revolution.

### Attributes of populist parties/candidates

Next, we use six other variables relating to other aspects of
candidates' actions and backgrounds:

#### LIBDEMNORMS 

*Does the party/candidate's behaviour threaten established liberal
democratic norms - engaging in political violence, resisting
constitutional rules and institutional processes, showing hostility to
judicial oversight, or attacking on media scrutiny - compared with
predecessors and contemporaries?*

> 1\. (No) Party/candidate does not threaten established liberal
> democratic norms.
>
> 2\. (Partial) Party/candidate represents a moderate threat to
> established liberal democratic norms.
>
> 3\. (Yes) Party/candidate represents a stark break from established
> liberal democratic norms.

LIBDEMNORMS measures whether or not the behaviour and/or speech of
parties/candidates threatens established liberal democratic norms. We
consider these threats to include: a) inciting, tolerating or organising
violence against opponents, b) attacking the freedom of the press, c)
threatening democratic institutions (for example undermining the
credibility of electoral institutions or demanding that political
opponents be prosecuted), d) expressing a dislike of democratic
institutions (including offering praise for domestic or foreign
dictatorial regimes) and e) (for incumbents) "state capture," in the
form of personalising the resources and violence of the state. This is
similar to "authoritarian" behaviour in other datasets.

While ethnonationalism or exclusion of migrants are arguably threats to
liberal democratic norms, we have not included them in this variable
given that they are captured by the OTH_ETHNIC and OTH_IMMIGRANTS
variables. "Liberal" democratic norms here do not relate to liberal
economic policies or attitudes, meaning that a party/candidate could be
hostile to liberal economic norms without being opposed to liberal
democratic ones in our definition of LIBDEMNORMS.

Given that liberal democratic norms vary greatly *prior* to the entry of
any given populist parties/candidates, WPD codes relative to the
"established" standards of the polity. That is, parties/candidate's
behaviour only registers on this scale when it is seen to shift norms
away from liberal democracy, not merely when it is in line with the
non-liberal democratic norms practiced by predecessors and contemporary
rivals. The three levels of LIBDEMNORMS do not therefore relate to
absolute standards of behaviour across all cases, but the degree to
which populist parties/candidates shift or threaten their countries'
established democratic norms. When this is ambiguous, we've erred on the
side of coding higher rather than lower.

Parties/candidates who are incumbent in government have a different
capacity to threaten liberal democratic norms than those who are
non-incumbent. For example, it is possible for parties who showed no
signs of threatening liberal-democratic norms from restricting press
freedom or judicial oversight.

#### CHARISMA

*Is the personal charisma of the candidate or party leader essential to
their campaign's political appeal?*

> 1\. (No) The leader is not essential to the political appeal of the
> campaign, and the party or movement would likely exist without this
> leader.
>
> 2\. (Partial) The leader is an important element of the campaign's
> political appeal, but the party or movement would likely exist without
> this leader.
>
> 3\. (Yes) The leader is essential to the campaign's political appeal,
> and the party or movement would not likely exist without this leader.

The CHARISMA variable captures populist parties' or movements' potential
dependence on their leaders - something routinely cited in the
theoretical literature on populism. We have identified CHARISMA in
candidates/parties when sources suggest that the appeal of a particular
movement is tied up in the personality of its leader in the sense of
being "leader-centric" or a "one-man/women" show. This is the case for
many populist movements formed around a single individual, such as Clive
Palmer's United Australia Party, Joseph Estrada's Forces of the Filipino
Masses in the Philippines - each of which would stand no chance of
existing without these leaders.

The term "movement" here relates to the fact that independent
presidential candidacies could still plausibly have non-partisan
foundations, such as support from coalitions of political parties
(though this is rare).

As it is difficult to scale the significance of leadership, we
differentiate between 3 and 2 not based on difference in charismatic
appeal, but on whether evidence suggests that parties have an
institutional base beyond its current leader -- particularly as
evidenced by a history that predates that leader -- such that it
probably exists "beyond" them in some way. Therefore, there is not
always a difference in the presence of charismatic leadership between
cases coded 2 or 3.

In some cases CHARISMA can be based on politicians who are not actually
leaders of their party, but none-the-less essential to their appeal. For
example, Thailand's Pheu Thai (PT) is the successor party to Thaksin
Shinawatra's Thai Rak Tai (TRT) party, formed after TRT was overthrown
in a 2006 military coup in Thailand. Even in exile however, evidence
suggests that Thaksin's image was still essential to the party's image
and appeal. In such cases we have still coded 3 if that leader remains
an essential component of the party's identity at the time of the
election under analysis.

#### INC_PARL

*Is the legislative party incumbent in government at the time of the
election?*

> 1\. Not in government
>
> 2\. In coalition government but not head of government
>
> 3\. In coalition government with head of government
>
> 4\. In government outright

INC_PARL captures whether or not legislative parties are in government
at the time of the election campaign under analysis. Presidential
election entries are coded "N/A" on this variable.

Each coding decision relates to the time immediately before the election
in question. When a party has been in government briefly in the previous
term but has left before the election, or when a party has joined a
governing coalition soon before the election, we still code whatever is
the case at the time of the election.

Parliamentary coalitions make incumbency difficult ot assess as there
are many cases where incumbency is not clear cut in coalitions with
junior/minor parties. We use the position of head of government as a
proxy for this, hence the difference between 2 and 3 above. For systems
where the President is the head of government, (e.g. France, Argentina)
that still counts for parliamentary parties. Likewise, when a party has
a parliamentary majority, but the presidential head of government is
from another party, they are coded 1.

In cases where parties appear to lend support on a more informal basis
to incumbent presidents from different parties or who are independents,
we do not include this as in government or coalition. This is common in
Latin America.

#### INC_PRES

*Is the presidential candidate incumbent in government at the time of
the election?*

> 1\. Not incumbent
>
> 2\. Not personally incumbent, but same party as incumbent
>
> 3\. Incumbent

As with INC_PARL, we code for whatever is the case immediately prior to
the election. Legislative election entries are coded "N/A" on this
variable. "In government" refers to the office that is being sought in
that election, not any government office.

#### INSIDER

*Has party leader or candidate been in government in the past?*

> 1\. (No) Leader has never featured in government before this election.
>
> 2\. (Partial) Leader has featured in previous governments, but did not
> lead them.
>
> 3\. (Yes) leader has been a head of government before this election.

INSIDER captures whether or not party leaders or candidates have been in
positions of government before the election under analysis. In both
legislative and executive entries, we are interested in the history of
the current leader rather than the party historically.

Level 3 is reserved for leaders who are previous heads of government.
This could be incumbent heads of government, or non-incumbent former
heads of government. Leaders are coded 2 when they featured prominently
in previous governments without serving as head of government. For
example, Corneliu Vadim Tudor was leader of the Greater Romanian Party
(PRM) when it was briefly in coalition government in 1992, meaning that
PRM is coded 2 on INSIDER for the duration of the time that he was its
leader. Similarly Cuauhtemoc Cardenas was a key figure in several PRI
governments in Mexico before he contested from 1988 - he and the parties
he led are coded 2 for this reason.

Only prior offices held at the national level are considered. Parties
whose leaders held office at the subnational or local level are still
coded 1 if they have never held national office.

All incumbent leaders are coded 3 on this scale, even if they were coded
1 or 2 during their initial election.

**LRPOSITION**

*Where does the candidate/party stand on the left-right ideological
spectrum?*

> FR Far right
>
> R Right
>
> CR Centre right
>
> C Centrist
>
> CL Centre left
>
> L Left
>
> FL Far left
>
> N/A Not applicable (i.e., satirical candidate)

LRPOSITION codes parties/candidates according to where they fall on the
left-right ideological spectrum. This is based on the general
assessments in the literature as well as our own understanding of
left-right ideology. When parties/candidates have differed in their
conventional left-right position between, for example social/cultural
politics (immigration, ethnocentrism, etc.) and economic policies
(taxes, welfare, etc.) we have coded based on the relative salience of
each category. For examples, we have coded parties like Ataka in
Bulgaria and the True Finns party in Finland as right wing due to the
relative salience of their ethnonatioalism, even though they also favour
economic policies wh

In cases where left-right ideological profiles have been difficult to
determine due to either the balance of clearly left- and right- leaning
positions, we have erred on the side of classifying parties as C.
Examples of this are Beppe Grillo's Five Star Movement in Italy, or
Andrzej Lepper's Self-Defence in Poland.

In cases where populist protest parties make no claim to any policy
position other than ridicule of the political establishment, such as
Estonia's Independent Royalists, we have coded them as N/A (Not
Applicable).

### Elections and electoral systems

Elections are recorded by **YEAR** \[yyyy\] and **MONTH** \[m\], and
also by **DATE** \[dd/mm/yyyy\]**.** The dataset included
candidates/parties in both presidential and (various kinds of)
legislative elections. These are distinguished by the **TYPE** variable:

  ----------- -------------------------------------------------- ---------
  PR          Presidential                                       

  LH          Lower House (including when upper house is not     
              directly elected)                                  

  LH+UH       Both upper and lower house elected in single       
              ballot system                                      

  UC          Unicameral                                         

                                                                 
  ----------- -------------------------------------------------- ---------

A second column, **ROUND** is used to denote whether election result is
in the first or second round of a two-round system, in either
presidential or legislative elections:

  ------------- ---------------------------------------------------------
  1             First Round

  2             Second round

  N/A           Not applicable
  ------------- ---------------------------------------------------------

A second column, **SYSTEM** is used to denote the different
representational systems that the result in question refers to:

  ---------- ---------------------------------------------------------- --
  CON        Constituency seats (as opposed to proportional             
             representation)                                            

  PRO        Proportional representation seats (as opposed to           
             constituencies)                                            

  DIA        Diaspora representatives                                   
  ---------- ---------------------------------------------------------- --

Note: the SYSTEM variable is only used when election to one legislative
chamber (LH/UC) involves two balloting systems. It does not denote
different methods of legislative election via a single ballot, such as
mixed constituency and proportional representation systems, etc. If
there was only one ballot, and therefore only one total percentage, then
the system column is listed with "N/A".

# Data Sources

**Coding data**

Data for these evaluations was sourced primarily from secondary academic
sources, but also from reliable online analysis (reputable blogs,
analysis sites, etc.), news sources, and occasionally primary sources
from candidates/parties such as speeches or manifestos. By far the most
common source is secondary academic literature, as this material tends
to include the richest description of populist rhetoric and appeal. Data
sources used for coding have been laid out in a separate Case Notes
document.

## Election data

Election results data was sourced from a number of datasets and outlets,
each of which is listed in the SOURCE column of the spreadsheet, with a
link copied in the SOURCELINK column. In order of preference, these are:

  ---------------------------------------------- ------------------------
  **Source**                                     **Reference in dataset**

Wherever possible, as few datasets as possible were used on individual
countries. When these databases did not provide relevant data, we have
used (in order):

# Cases (countries)

The beta dataset includes 50 democracies, all selected based on the
general reliability of official election results, and the availability
of sufficient secondary sources for coding. This meant that several
countries studied by coders were ruled ill-suited to the dataset despite
the clear presence of populism (Belarus, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Iran for
example).

The countries included are:

  -------------- --------------------------------------------------------
  Europe (27)    Albania, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czechia, Denmark,
                 Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary,
                 Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Netherlands, Norway,
                 Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Spain,
                 Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom

  South America  Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador,
  (8)            Peru, Venezuela

  North America  Canada, El Salvador, Mexico, United States
  (4)            

  Asia (7)       India, Indonesia, Japan, Pakistan, Philippines,
                 Thailand, T√ºrkiye

  Africa (2)     South Africa, Zambia

  Oceana (2)     Australia, New Zealand,
  -------------- --------------------------------------------------------

Numerous countries are not included for the breadth of the 1980-2020
period as they did not qualify as sufficiently democratic at every
point. For example, Eastern European post-communist countries are only
included after \~1990, South Africa is only included after 1994, the
Philippines after 1986.

The cases of Czechia and Slovakia are included as separate entities even
before their formal split in 1993 due to the fact that their electoral
processes were autonomous in these years, and hence there is historical
continuity with later elections.

## Elections coded

The dataset has coded a total of 809 elections (543 legislative and 266
presidential).

# Parties/candidates

Parties (including the independent status of some presidential
candidates) are listed in the **PARTY** variable, and candidates (in
presidential elections) are listed in the **CANDIDATE** variable.

The dataset includes parties/candidates which received over 5% at the
election being recoded.

## Rules for coding parties, and alliances

In parliamentary systems we assume that the actions and discourse of
party leaders constitute the essential meaning of the party as it is
understood by voters. In presidential systems this is more difficult, as
it is occasionally the case that presidential candidates have estranged
relationships with party leaders, and that candidates' discourse doesn't
necessarily imply that every voter at a legislative election is voting
for a populist party. For example, given the abnormally
institutionalised nature of the US two-party system, we don't find it
accurate to say that every vote for a Republican congressional candidate
in the 2016 US elections had the same populist meaning as the vote for
the party's presidential candidate Donald Trump. We have made this
judgment on a case by case basis and explained this choice in the case
notes.

When parties form alliances with each other, we have tried to treat them
as individual parties whenever electoral data allows us to do so (for
example, the Centre Right coalition in Italy's 2018 election). When this
is not possible due to the fact that alliances are single voting lists
or electoral entities, we have only considered these alliances populist
when populist parties appear to account for the majority of their
candidates and or leaders (that is, when populist parties are the
dominant partner). This was the case for the Japanese Restoration Party
of Toru Hashimoto, a regional party which merged with another party (The
Japan Sunrise Party) before the 2012 election.

When parties have merged with other parties, we have usually considered
them as continuations of predecessor parties in cases where those
parties were significantly bigger than others. For example, Sylvio
Berlusconi's Forza Italia (FI) merged with the National Alliance (NA)
party in 2009 to create the People of Freedom (PDL). However, as FI was
significantly bigger than the NA, and Berlusconi remained it's leader
after the merge, we have considered PDL as a continuation of FI, and
carried coding decisions of the latter into the former after 2009.

In presidential systems it is common for parties who run separately in
parliamentary elections form electoral coalitions for the presidential
elections. This is usually the case in many Latin American countries. In
these cases, we have coded the relevant electoral base of the populist
leader. For example, for the Chilean party UDI under the leadership of
populist leader Joaqu√≠n Lavin (1999-2005) we have coded "Independent
Democratic Union" for the parliamentary elections and "Independent
Democratic Union / Alliance for Chile" for the presidential elections.

One particularly difficult case is Argentina, which has undergone a
shift in its party system. At the time of Carlos Menem and Nestor
Kirchner's leadership in the 1990s- early 2000s, we consider the
Justicialist party to be representative of its leaders' discourse, and
therefore a populist entity linked to that leader. However, Cristina
Fern√°ndez de Kirchner, also of the Justicialist party, formed the Front
for Victory alliance with members of her party and others. Given that
votes for this alliance can be tabulated separately, we treat this
entity as a party rather than the Justicialists.
